2  “Blow a horn in Zion!+ Shout a war cry in my holy mountain. Let all the inhabitants of the land* tremble,For the day of Jehovah is coming!+ It is near! 
 2  It is a day of darkness and gloom,+A day of clouds and thick gloom,+Like light of dawn spreading out on the mountains. There is a people numerous and mighty;+Never before has there been one like it,And never again will there be anotherThrough the years of all generations. 
 3  Ahead of it a fire devours,And behind it a flame consumes.+ The land ahead of it is like the garden of Eʹden,+But behind it is a desolate wilderness,And nothing can escape. 
 4  Its appearance is like the appearance of horses,And they run like warhorses.+ 
 5  The sound is like that of chariots as they leap on the mountaintops,+Like the crackling of a blazing fire that consumes stubble. It is like a mighty people drawn up in battle formation.+ 
 6  Because of them, peoples will be in anguish. Every face will grow flushed. 
 7  They charge like warriors,They scale a wall like soldiers,Each keeps to his own course,And they do not swerve from their paths. 
 8  They do not shove one another;Each man advances in his course. If the weapons* cause some to fall,The others do not break ranks. 
 9  Into the city they rush, on the wall they run. Onto the houses they climb, through the windows they enter like a thief. 
10  Before them the land trembles and the heavens rock. Sun and moon have become dark,+And the stars have lost their brightness. 
11  Jehovah will raise his voice before his army,+ for his camp is very numerous.+ For the one carrying out His word is mighty;For the day of Jehovah is great and very awe-inspiring.+ Who can endure it?”+ 
12  “Yet even now,” declares Jehovah, “return to me with all your hearts,+With fasting+ and weeping and wailing. 
13  Rip apart your hearts,+ and not your garments,+And return to Jehovah your God,For he is compassionate* and merciful, slow to anger+ and abundant in loyal love,+And he will reconsider* the calamity. 
14  Who knows whether he will turn back and reconsider*+And leave behind a blessing,A grain offering and a drink offering for Jehovah your God? 
15  Blow a horn in Zion! Proclaim* a fast; call for a solemn assembly.+ 
16  Gather the people; sanctify the congregation.+ Collect the old men;* gather the children and nursing infants.+ Let the bridegroom go out from his inner chamber, and the bride from her bridal chamber. 
17  Between the porch and the altar+Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep and say: ‘Do feel pity, O Jehovah, for your people;Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn,Letting the nations rule over them. Why should the peoples say, “Where is their God?”’+ 
18  Then Jehovah will be zealous for his landAnd show compassion on his people.+ 
19  Jehovah will answer his people: ‘Here I am sending to you grain and new wine and oil,And you will be fully satisfied;+I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.+ 
20  I will drive the northerner far away from you;I will disperse him to a dry and desolate wasteland,With his vanguard* toward the eastern sea*And his rear guard toward the western sea.* The foul smell from him will ascend,The stench from him will keep ascending;+For He will do great things.’ 
21  Do not be afraid, O land. Be joyful and rejoice, for Jehovah will do great things. 
22  Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field,For the pastures of the wilderness will become green,+And the trees will bear fruit;+The fig tree and the vine must give their full yield.+ 
23  You sons of Zion, be joyful and rejoice in Jehovah your God;+For he will give you the autumn rain in the right amount,And he will send upon you a downpour,The autumn rain and the spring rain, as before.+ 
24  The threshing floors will be full of pure grain,And the presses will overflow with new wine and oil.+ 
25  And I will make compensation to you for the yearsThat the swarming locust, the unwinged locust, the voracious locust, and the devouring locust have eaten,My great army that I sent among you.+ 
26  You will surely eat to satisfaction,+And you will praise the name of Jehovah your God,+Who has done wonders in your behalf;My people will never again be put to shame.+ 
27  And you will have to know that I am in the midst of Israel+And that I am Jehovah your God+—there is no other! My people will never again be put to shame. 
28  After that I will pour out my spirit+ on every sort of flesh,And your sons and your daughters will prophesy,Your old men will dream dreams,And your young men will see visions.+ 
29  And even on my male slaves and female slavesI will pour out my spirit in those days. 
30  And I will give wonders* in the heavens and on the earth,Blood and fire and columns of smoke.+ 
31  The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood+Before the coming of the great and awe-inspiring day of Jehovah.+ 
32  And everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved;+For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,+ just as Jehovah has said,The survivors whom Jehovah calls.”
