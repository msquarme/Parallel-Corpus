25  Now Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Ke·tuʹrah.
2  In time she bore him Zimʹran, Jokʹshan, Meʹdan, Midʹi·an,+ Ishʹbak, and Shuʹah.+ 
3  Jokʹshan became father to Sheʹba and Deʹdan. The sons of Deʹdan were As·shuʹrim, Le·tuʹshim, and Le·umʹmim. 
4  The sons of Midʹi·an were Eʹphah, Eʹpher, Haʹnoch, A·biʹda, and El·daʹah. All of these were the sons of Ke·tuʹrah. 
5  Later on Abraham gave everything he had to Isaac,+
6  but Abraham gave gifts to his sons by his concubines. Then while he was still alive, he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son,+ to the land of the East.
7  The years of Abraham’s life were 175 years.
8  Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, old and satisfied, and was gathered to his people.*
9  His sons Isaac and Ishʹma·el buried him in the cave of Mach·peʹlah in the field of Eʹphron the son of Zoʹhar the Hitʹtite that is in front of Mamʹre,+
10  the field that Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, with his wife Sarah.+
11  After Abraham’s death, God continued to bless his son Isaac,+ and Isaac was dwelling near Beʹer-laʹhai-roi.+ 
12  This is the history of Ishʹma·el+ the son of Abraham whom Haʹgar+ the Egyptian, the servant of Sarah, bore to Abraham. 
13  Now these are the names of the sons of Ishʹma·el, by their names according to their family origins: Ishʹma·el’s firstborn Ne·baʹioth,+ then Keʹdar,+ Adʹbe·el, Mibʹsam,+
14  Mishʹma, Duʹmah, Masʹsa,
15  Haʹdad, Teʹma, Jeʹtur, Naʹphish, and Kedʹe·mah.
16  These are the sons of Ishʹma·el, and these are their names by their settlements and by their encampments,* 12 chieftains according to their clans.+
17  And Ishʹma·el lived for 137 years. Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people.*
18  And they took up dwelling from Havʹi·lah+ near Shur,+ which is close to Egypt, as far as As·syrʹi·a. He settled near all his brothers.*+ 
19  And this is the history of Isaac the son of Abraham.+ Abraham became father to Isaac.
20  Isaac was 40 years old when he married Re·bekʹah, the daughter of Be·thuʹel+ the A·ra·maeʹan of Padʹdan-aʹram, the sister of Laʹban the A·ra·maeʹan.
21  And Isaac kept pleading with Jehovah regarding his wife, because she was barren; so Jehovah responded to his plea, and his wife Re·bekʹah became pregnant.
22  And the sons within her began to struggle with each other,+ so that she said: “If this is the way it is, why should I go on living?” So she inquired of Jehovah.
23  And Jehovah said to her: “Two nations are in your womb,+ and two peoples will be separated from within you;+ and the one nation will be stronger than the other nation,+ and the older will serve the younger.”+ 
24  When the time came for her to give birth, look! twins were in her womb.
25  Then the first came out red all over and was like a garment of hair,+ so they named him Eʹsau.*+
26  After that his brother came out and his hand was holding onto the heel of Eʹsau,+ so he named him Jacob.*+ Isaac was 60 years old when she gave birth to them. 
27  As the boys got bigger, Eʹsau became a skilled hunter,+ a man of the field, but Jacob was a blameless man, dwelling in tents.+
28  And Isaac loved Eʹsau because it meant game in his mouth, whereas Re·bekʹah loved Jacob.+
29  On one occasion Jacob was boiling some stew when Eʹsau returned from the field exhausted.
30  So Eʹsau said to Jacob: “Quick, please, give me some* of the red stew that you have there,* for I am exhausted!”* That is why his name was Eʹdom.*+
31  To this Jacob said: “First sell me your right as firstborn!”+
32  And Eʹsau continued: “Here I am about to die! What use is a birthright to me?”
33  And Jacob added: “Swear to me first!” So he swore to him and sold his right as firstborn to Jacob.+
34  Then Jacob gave Eʹsau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and he got up and went away. Thus Eʹsau despised the birthright.
