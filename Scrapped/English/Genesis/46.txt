46  So Israel took all that he had* and departed. When he arrived at Beʹer-sheʹba,+ he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.+
2  Then God spoke to Israel in a vision by night and said: “Jacob, Jacob!” to which he said: “Here I am!”
3  He said: “I am the true God, the God of your father.+ Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation.+
4  I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I myself will also bring you back from there,+ and Joseph will lay his hand on your eyes.”*+ 
5  After that Jacob departed from Beʹer-sheʹba, and the sons of Israel transported Jacob their father and their children and their wives in the wagons that Pharʹaoh had sent to transport him.
6  They took along their herds and their goods, which they had accumulated in the land of Caʹnaan. And so they came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him.
7  He brought with him into Egypt his sons and his grandsons, his daughters and his granddaughters—all his offspring. 
8  Now these are the names of Israel’s sons who came into Egypt,+ Jacob and his sons: Jacob’s firstborn was Reuʹben.+ 
9  The sons of Reuʹben were Haʹnoch, Palʹlu, Hezʹron, and Carʹmi.+ 
10  The sons of Simʹe·on+ were Jem·uʹel, Jaʹmin, Oʹhad, Jaʹchin, Zoʹhar, and Shaʹul+ the son of a Caʹnaan·ite woman. 
11  The sons of Leʹvi+ were Gerʹshon, Koʹhath, and Me·rarʹi.+ 
12  The sons of Judah+ were Er, Oʹnan, Sheʹlah,+ Peʹrez,+ and Zeʹrah.+ However, Er and Oʹnan died in the land of Caʹnaan.+ The sons of Peʹrez came to be Hezʹron and Haʹmul.+ 
13  The sons of Isʹsa·char were Toʹla, Puʹvah, Iob, and Shimʹron.+ 
14  The sons of Zebʹu·lun+ were Seʹred, Eʹlon, and Jahʹle·el.+ 
15  These are the sons of Leʹah, whom she bore to Jacob in Padʹdan-aʹram, together with his daughter Diʹnah.+ All his sons and his daughters* numbered 33. 
16  The sons of Gad+ were Ziphʹi·on, Hagʹgi, Shuʹni, Ezʹbon, Eʹri, Ar·oʹdi, and A·reʹli.+ 
17  The sons of Ashʹer+ were Imʹnah, Ishʹvah, Ishʹvi, and Be·riʹah, and their sister was Seʹrah. The sons of Be·riʹah were Heʹber and Malʹchi·el.+ 
18  These are the sons of Zilʹpah,+ whom Laʹban gave to his daughter Leʹah. She bore these to Jacob: 16 persons* in all. 
19  The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel were Joseph+ and Benjamin.+ 
20  There were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt Ma·nasʹseh+ and Eʹphra·im,+ whom Asʹe·nath+ the daughter of Pot·iʹphe·ra the priest of On* bore to him. 
21  The sons of Benjamin+ were Beʹla, Beʹcher, Ashʹbel, Geʹra,+ Naʹa·man, Eʹhi, Rosh, Mupʹpim, Hupʹpim,+ and Ard.+ 
22  These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob: 14 persons* in all. 
23  The son* of Dan+ was Huʹshim.+ 
24  The sons of Naphʹta·li+ were Jahʹze·el, Guʹni, Jeʹzer, and Shilʹlem.+ 
25  These are the sons of Bilʹhah, whom Laʹban gave to his daughter Rachel. She bore these to Jacob: seven persons* in all. 
26  All those* who descended from Jacob and went into Egypt with him, aside from the wives of Jacob’s sons, were 66.+
27  Joseph’s sons who were born to him in Egypt were two.* All the people* of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were 70.+ 
28  Jacob sent Judah+ ahead to tell Joseph that he was on the way to Goʹshen. When they came into the land of Goʹshen,+
29  Joseph had his chariot prepared and went up to meet Israel his father at Goʹshen. When he presented himself to him, he at once embraced him* and wept for some time.*
30  Then Israel said to Joseph: “Now I am ready to die; I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.” 
31  Joseph then said to his brothers and to his father’s household: “Let me go up and report to Pharʹaoh+ and tell him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Caʹnaan have come here to me.+
32  The men are shepherds,+ and they raise livestock,+ and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’+
33  When Pharʹaoh calls you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’
34  you must say, ‘Your servants have raised livestock from our youth until now, both we and our forefathers,’+ so that you may dwell in the land of Goʹshen,+ for every herder of sheep is detestable to the Egyptians.”+
