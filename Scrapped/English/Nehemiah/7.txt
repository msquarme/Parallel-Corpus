7  As soon as the wall had been rebuilt+ I set up the doors;+ then the gatekeepers,+ the singers,+ and the Levites+ were appointed.
2  I then put my brother Ha·naʹni+ in charge of Jerusalem, along with Han·a·niʹah the chief of the Fortress,+ for he was a most trustworthy man and feared the true God+ more than many others.
3  So I said to them: “The gates of Jerusalem should not be opened until the heat of the day, and while they are standing guard, they should shut the doors and bolt them. And assign the inhabitants of Jerusalem as guards, each to his assigned guardpost and each in front of his own house.”
4  Now the city was spacious and large, and there were few people inside it,+ and the houses had not been rebuilt. 
5  But my God put it into my heart to gather together the nobles and the deputy rulers and the people to be enrolled genealogically.+ Then I found the book of genealogical enrollment of those who first came up, and I found written in it: 
6  And these were the people of the province* who came up out of the captivity of the exiles, those whom King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar+ of Babylon had exiled+ and who later returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city,+
7  those who came with Ze·rubʹba·bel,+ Jeshʹu·a,+ Ne·he·miʹah, Az·a·riʹah, Ra·a·miʹah, Na·hamʹa·ni, Morʹde·cai, Bilʹshan, Misʹpe·reth, Bigʹvai, Neʹhum, and Baʹa·nah. The number of the Israelite men included:+

64  These looked for their records to establish their genealogy, but they could not be found, so they were disqualified from the priesthood.*+
