2  “This is what Jehovah says,‘“For three revolts* of Moʹab,+ and for four, I will not reverse it,Because he burned the bones of the king of Eʹdom for lime. 
 2  So I will send a fire into Moʹab,And it will consume the fortified towers of Keʹri·oth;+Moʹab will die amid an uproar,With a war cry, with the sound of a horn.+ 
 3  I will remove the ruler* from her midstAnd kill all her princes along with him,”+ says Jehovah.’ 
 4  This is what Jehovah says,‘For three revolts of Judah,+ and for four, I will not reverse it,Because they rejected the law* of Jehovah,And because they did not keep his regulations;+But the same lies their forefathers followed have led them astray.+ 
 5  So I will send a fire into Judah,And it will consume the fortified towers of Jerusalem.’+ 
 6  This is what Jehovah says,‘For three revolts of Israel,+ and for four, I will not reverse it,Because they sell the righteous for silver,And the poor for a pair of sandals.+ 
 7  They trample the heads of the lowly into the dust of the earth,+And they block the path of the meek.+ A man and his father have relations with the same girl,Profaning my holy name. 
 8  They stretch out next to every altar+ on garments they seized as security for a loan;*+And the wine they drink at the house* of their gods was obtained from those they fined.’ 
 9  ‘But it was I who annihilated the Amʹor·ite before them,+Who was as tall as the cedars and as strong as the oaks;I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below.+ 
10  I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,+And I made you walk through the wilderness 40 years,+To take possession of the land of the Amʹor·ite. 
11  I raised up some of your sons as prophets+And some of your young men as Nazʹi·rites.+ Is this not so, O people of Israel?’ declares Jehovah. 
12  ‘But you kept giving the Nazʹi·rites wine to drink,+And you commanded the prophets: “You must not prophesy.”+ 
13  So I will crush you in your place,Just as a wagon loaded with cut grain crushes what is under it. 
14  The swift one will have no place to flee,+The strong one will not retain his power,And no warrior will escape with his life.* 
15  The bowman will not stand his ground,The swift of foot will not escape,And the horseman will not escape with his life.* 
16  Even the most courageous* among the warriorsWill flee naked in that day,’+ declares Jehovah.”
