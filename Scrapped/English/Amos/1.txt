1  The words of Aʹmos,* who was among the sheep raisers from Te·koʹa,+ which he received in vision concerning Israel in the days of King Uz·ziʹah+ of Judah and in the days of Jer·o·boʹam+ son of Joʹash,+ the king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.+
2  He said: “Jehovah will roar out of Zion,And he will raise his voice out of Jerusalem. The pastures of the shepherds will mourn,And the summit of Carʹmel will dry up.”+ 
 3  “This is what Jehovah says,‘“For three revolts* of Damascus, and for four, I will not reverse it,Because they threshed Gilʹe·ad with iron threshing sledges.+ 
 4  So I will send a fire upon the house of Hazʹa·el,+And it will consume the fortified towers of Ben-haʹdad.+ 
 5  I will break the bars of Damascus;+I will destroy the inhabitants from Bikʹath-aʹvenAnd the one ruling* from Beth-eʹden;And the people of Syria will go as exiles to Kir,”+ says Jehovah.’ 
 6  This is what Jehovah says,‘“For three revolts of Gazʹa,+ and for four, I will not reverse it,Because they took a whole group of exiles+ to hand them over to Eʹdom. 
 7  So I will send a fire onto the wall of Gazʹa,+And it will consume her fortified towers. 
 8  I will destroy the inhabitants from Ashʹdod,+And the one ruling* from Ashʹke·lon;+I will turn my hand against Ekʹron,+And the remaining Phi·lisʹtines will perish,”+ says the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.’ 
 9  This is what Jehovah says,‘For three revolts of Tyre,+ and for four, I will not reverse it,Because they handed over a whole group of exiles to Eʹdom,And because they did not remember the covenant of brothers.+ 
10  So I will send a fire onto the wall of Tyre,And it will consume her fortified towers.’+ 
11  This is what Jehovah says,‘For three revolts of Eʹdom,+ and for four, I will not reverse it,Because he pursued his own brother with the sword,+And because he refused to show mercy;In his anger he keeps tearing them apart relentlessly,And he remains furious with them continually.+ 
12  So I will send a fire into Teʹman,+And it will consume the fortified towers of Bozʹrah.’+ 
13  This is what Jehovah says,‘“For three revolts of the Amʹmon·ites,+ and for four, I will not reverse it,Because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilʹe·ad to widen out their own territory.+ 
14  So I will set fire to the wall of Rabʹbah,+And it will consume her fortified towers,With a war cry in the day of battle,With a tempest in the day of storm wind. 
15  And their king will go into exile together with his princes,”+ says Jehovah.’
