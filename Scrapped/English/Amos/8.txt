8  This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah showed me: Look! There was a basket of summer fruit.
2  Then he said, “What do you see, Aʹmos?” I replied, “A basket of summer fruit.” Then Jehovah said to me: “The end has come for my people Israel. I will no longer pardon them.+
3  ‘The songs of the temple will turn into wailing in that day,’+ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. ‘There will be many carcasses thrown everywhere+—hush!’ 
 4  Hear this, you who trample on the poorAnd who bring the meek of the land to an end,+
 5  Who say, ‘When will the new moon festival be over,+ that we may sell our grain,And the Sabbath,+ that we may offer grain for sale? So that we may make the eʹphah* measure smallerAnd the shekel* weight greater,To falsify our scales of deception;+
 6  So that we may buy the needy for silverAnd the poor for a pair of sandals,+And sell the worthless part of the grain.’ 
 7  Jehovah has sworn by the Pride of Jacob,+‘Never will I forget all their deeds.+ 
 8  On this account the land* will tremble,And every inhabitant in it will mourn.+ Will it not all rise like the Nile,And surge and sink down like the Nile of Egypt?’+ 
 9  ‘In that day,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah,‘I will make the sun go down at high noon,And I will darken the land on a bright day.+ 
10  I will turn your festivals into mourning+And all your songs into dirges.* I will put sackcloth on all hips and make every head bald;I will make it like the mourning for an only son,And the end of it like a bitter day.’ 
11  ‘Look! The days are coming,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah,‘When I will send a famine into the land,Not a famine for bread or a thirst for water,But for hearing the words of Jehovah.+ 
12  They will stagger from sea to seaAnd from the north to the east.* They will rove about searching for the word of Jehovah, but they will not find it. 
13  In that day beautiful virgins will faint,Also young men, because of the thirst;
14  Those who swear by the guilt of Sa·marʹi·a+ and who say,“As surely as your god lives, O Dan!”+ And, “As surely as the way of Beʹer-sheʹba+ lives!” They will fall, and they will not rise up again.’”+
