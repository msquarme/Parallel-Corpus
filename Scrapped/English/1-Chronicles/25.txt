25  Further, David and the chiefs of the groups for the service separated some of the sons of Aʹsaph, Heʹman, and Je·duʹthun+ to serve by prophesying with the harps, the stringed instruments,+ and the cymbals.+ The list of the official men for this service was,
2  of the sons of Aʹsaph: Zacʹcur, Joseph, Neth·a·niʹah, and Ash·a·reʹlah, the sons of Aʹsaph under the direction of Aʹsaph, who prophesied under the direction of the king.
3  Of Je·duʹthun,+ the sons of Je·duʹthun: Ged·a·liʹah, Zeʹri, Je·shaʹiah, Shimʹe·i, Hash·a·biʹah, and Mat·ti·thiʹah,+ six, under the direction of their father Je·duʹthun, who prophesied with the harp, thanking and praising Jehovah.+
4  Of Heʹman,+ the sons of Heʹman: Buk·kiʹah, Mat·ta·niʹah, Uzʹzi·el, Shebʹu·el, Jerʹi·moth, Han·a·niʹah, Ha·naʹni, E·liʹa·thah, Gid·dalʹti, Ro·mamʹti-eʹzer, Josh·be·kashʹah, Mal·loʹthi, Hoʹthir, and Ma·haʹzi·oth.
5  All of these were sons of Heʹman, a visionary of the king in matters pertaining to the true God to his glory;* thus the true God gave Heʹman 14 sons and 3 daughters.
6  All of these were under the direction of their father for singing at the house of Jehovah, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps+ for the service of the house of the true God. Under the king’s direction were Aʹsaph, Je·duʹthun, and Heʹman. 
7  The number of them and their brothers who were trained in song to Jehovah, all experts, was 288.
8  So they cast lots+ for their duties, the small and the great alike, the expert along with the learner. 
9  The first lot to come out belonged to Aʹsaph for Joseph,+ the second for Ged·a·liʹah+ (he and his brothers and his sons were 12);
10  the third for Zacʹcur,+ his sons and his brothers, 12;
11  the fourth for Izʹri, his sons and his brothers, 12;
12  the fifth for Neth·a·niʹah,+ his sons and his brothers, 12;
13  the sixth for Buk·kiʹah, his sons and his brothers, 12;
14  the seventh for Jesh·a·reʹlah, his sons and his brothers, 12;
15  the eighth for Je·shaʹiah, his sons and his brothers, 12;
16  the ninth for Mat·ta·niʹah, his sons and his brothers, 12;
17  the tenth for Shimʹe·i, his sons and his brothers, 12;
18  the 11th for Azʹar·el, his sons and his brothers, 12;
19  the 12th for Hash·a·biʹah, his sons and his brothers, 12;
20  for the 13th, Shuʹba·el,+ his sons and his brothers, 12;
21  for the 14th, Mat·ti·thiʹah, his sons and his brothers, 12;
22  for the 15th, for Jerʹe·moth, his sons and his brothers, 12;
23  for the 16th, for Han·a·niʹah, his sons and his brothers, 12;
24  for the 17th, for Josh·be·kashʹah, his sons and his brothers, 12;
25  for the 18th, for Ha·naʹni, his sons and his brothers, 12;
26  for the 19th, for Mal·loʹthi, his sons and his brothers, 12;
27  for the 20th, for E·liʹa·thah, his sons and his brothers, 12;
28  for the 21st, for Hoʹthir, his sons and his brothers, 12;
29  for the 22nd, for Gid·dalʹti,+ his sons and his brothers, 12;
30  for the 23rd, for Ma·haʹzi·oth,+ his sons and his brothers, 12;
31  for the 24th, for Ro·mamʹti-eʹzer,+ his sons and his brothers, 12.
