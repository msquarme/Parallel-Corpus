63  Who is this coming from Eʹdom,+From Bozʹrah+ with bright-colored* garments,This one with splendid clothing,Marching in his great power? “It is I, the One speaking in righteousness,The One with great power to save.” 
 2  Why is your clothing red,And why are your garments like those of one treading the winepress?+ 
 3  “I have trodden the wine trough alone. No one from the peoples was with me. I kept treading them in my anger,And I kept trampling them in my wrath.+ My garments were spattered with their blood,And I have stained all my clothing. 
 4  For the day of vengeance is in my heart,+And the year of my repurchased ones has come. 
 5  I looked, but there was no one to help;I was appalled that no one offered support. So my arm brought me salvation,*+And my own wrath supported me. 
 6  I trampled peoples in my anger,I made them drunk with my wrath+And poured out their blood on the ground.” 
 7  I will mention Jehovah’s acts of loyal love,The praiseworthy acts of Jehovah,Because of all that Jehovah has done for us,+The many good things he has done for the house of Israel,According to his mercy and his great loyal love. 
 8  For he said: “Surely they are my people, sons who will not be disloyal.”*+ So he became their Savior.+ 
 9  During all their distress it was distressing to him.+ And his own personal messenger* saved them.+ In his love and compassion he repurchased them,+And he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.+ 
10  But they rebelled+ and grieved his holy spirit.+ He then turned into their enemy,+And he fought against them.+ 
11  And they remembered the days of old,The days of Moses his servant: “Where is the One who brought them up out of the sea+ with the shepherds of his flock?+ Where is the One who put within him His holy spirit,+
12  The One who made His glorious arm go with the right hand of Moses,+The One who split the waters before them+To make an everlasting name for himself,+
13  The One who made them walk through the surging waters,*So that they walked without stumbling,Like a horse in the open country?* 
14  Just like livestock when they go down into the valley plain,The spirit of Jehovah made them rest.”+ This is how you led your people,To make a majestic* name for yourself.+ 
15  Look down from heaven and seeFrom your lofty abode of holiness and glory.* Where are your zeal and your mightiness,The stirring of your compassions*+ and your mercy?+ They are withheld from me. 
16  For you are our Father;+Although Abraham may not know usAnd Israel may not recognize us,You, O Jehovah, are our Father. Our Repurchaser of long ago is your name.+ 
17  Why do you, O Jehovah, let us* wander from your ways? Why do you let* our hearts become hard, so that we do not fear you?+ Return, for the sake of your servants,The tribes of your inheritance.+ 
18  Your holy people possessed it for a short time. Our adversaries have trampled on your sanctuary.+ 
19  For too long we have become like those you never ruled over,Like those never called by your name.
