62  For the sake of Zion I will not keep silent,+And for the sake of Jerusalem I will not keep stillUntil her righteousness shines like a bright light+And her salvation burns like a torch.+ 
 2  “The nations will see your righteousness, O woman,+And all kings your glory.+ And you will be called by a new name,+Which Jehovah’s own mouth will designate. 
 3  You will become a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah,A royal turban in the palm of your God. 
 4  No more will you be called an abandoned woman,+And your land will no longer be called desolate.+ But you will be called My Delight Is in Her,+And your land will be called the Married One. For Jehovah will take delight in you,And your land will be as one married. 
 5  For just as a young man marries a virgin,Your sons will marry you. With the rejoicing of a bridegroom over a bride,Your God will rejoice over you.+ 
 6  Upon your walls, O Jerusalem, I have commissioned watchmen. Continuously, all day long and all night long, they should not be silent. You who make mention of Jehovah,Do not rest,
 7  And do not give him any rest until he firmly establishes Jerusalem,Yes, until he makes her the praise of the earth.”+ 
 8  Jehovah has sworn an oath with his right hand, with his strong arm: “I will no longer give your grain as food to your enemies,Nor will foreigners drink your new wine, for which you have toiled.+ 
 9  But those gathering it will eat it and they will praise Jehovah;And those collecting it will drink it in my holy courtyards.”+ 
10  Pass through, pass through the gates. Clear the way for the people.+ Build up, build up the highway. Rid it of stones.+ Raise up a signal* for the peoples.+ 
11  Look! Jehovah has proclaimed to the ends of the earth: “Say to the daughter of Zion,‘Look! Your salvation is coming.+ Look! His reward is with him,And the wage he pays is before him.’”+ 
12  They will be called the holy people, those repurchased by Jehovah,+And you will be called Sought After, a City Not Abandoned.+
