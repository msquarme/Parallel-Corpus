38  In those days Hez·e·kiʹah became sick and was at the point of death.+ The prophet Isaiah+ the son of Aʹmoz came and said to him, “This is what Jehovah says: ‘Give instructions to your household, for you will die; you will not recover.’”+
2  At that Hez·e·kiʹah turned his face to the wall and began to pray to Jehovah:
3  “I beg you, O Jehovah, remember,+ please, how I have walked before you faithfully and with a complete heart,+ and I have done what was good in your eyes.” And Hez·e·kiʹah began to weep profusely. 
4  Then the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah, saying:
5  “Go back and say to Hez·e·kiʹah,+ ‘This is what Jehovah the God of David your forefather says: “I have heard your prayer.+ I have seen your tears.+ Here I am adding 15 years to your life,*+
6  and I will rescue you and this city out of the hand of the king of As·syrʹi·a, and I will defend this city.+
7  This is the sign from Jehovah to show you that Jehovah will carry out the word that he has spoken:+
8  Here I will make the declining shadow of the sun on the stairway* of Aʹhaz go back ten steps.”’”+ So the sun went back ten steps on the stairway that it had already descended. 
9  A writing* of King Hez·e·kiʹah of Judah when he became sick and recovered from his sickness. 
10  I said: “In the middle of my lifeI must go into the gates of the Grave.* I will be deprived of my remaining years.” 
11  I said: “I will not see Jah,* Jah in the land of the living.+ I will look no more on mankindWhen I am with the inhabitants of the place where everything ceases. 
12  My own dwelling has been pulled out and removed from me+Like the tent of a shepherd. I have rolled up my life like a loom worker;He cuts me off like the threads of the warp. From daylight to nightfall you keep bringing me to an end.+ 
13  I calm myself until the morning. Like a lion, he keeps breaking all my bones;From daylight to nightfall you keep bringing me to an end.+ 
14  Like the swift or the thrush,* so I keep chirping;+I keep cooing like the dove.+ My eyes look wearily to the height:+ ‘O Jehovah, I am in great distress;Be my support!’*+ 
15  What can I say? He has spoken to me and acted. I will walk humbly* all my yearsBecause of my bitter distress.* 
16  ‘O Jehovah, by these things* every man lives,And in them is the life of my spirit. You will restore me to health and preserve me alive.+ 
17  Look! Instead of peace, I had great bitterness;But in your fondness for me,*You preserved me from the pit of destruction.+ You have thrown all my sins behind your back.*+ 
18  For the Grave* cannot glorify you,+Death cannot praise you.+ Those who go down into the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness.+ 
19  The living, the living can praise you,Just as I can this day. A father can give his sons knowledge about your faithfulness.+ 
20  O Jehovah, save me,And we will play my songs on stringed instruments+All the days of our life at the house of Jehovah.’”+ 
21  Isaiah then said: “Bring a cake of pressed dried figs and apply it to the boil, so that he may recover.”+
22  Hez·e·kiʹah had asked: “What is the sign that I will go up to the house of Jehovah?”+
