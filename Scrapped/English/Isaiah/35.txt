35  The wilderness and the parched land will exult,+And the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron.*+ 
 2  Without fail it will blossom;+It will rejoice and shout for joy. The glory of Lebʹa·non will be given to it,+The splendor of Carʹmel+ and of Sharʹon.+ They will see the glory of Jehovah, the splendor of our God. 
 3  Strengthen the weak hands,And make firm the knees that are shaking.+ 
 4  Say to those who are anxious at heart: “Be strong. Do not be afraid. Look! Your own God will come with vengeance,God will come with retribution.+ He will come and save you.”+ 
 5  At that time the eyes of the blind will be opened,+And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.+ 
 6  At that time the lame will leap like the deer,+And the tongue of the speechless will shout for joy.+ For waters will burst forth in the wilderness,And streams in the desert plain. 
 7  The heat-parched ground will become a reedy pool,And the thirsty ground springs of water.+ In the lairs where jackals rested,+There will be green grass and reeds and papyrus. 
 8  And a highway will be there,+Yes, a way called the Way of Holiness. The unclean one will not travel on it.+ It is reserved for the one walking on the way;No one foolish will stray onto it. 
 9  No lion will be there,And no vicious wild beasts will come on it. They will not be found there;+Only the repurchased ones will walk there.+ 
10  Those redeemed by Jehovah will return+ and come to Zion with a joyful cry.+ Unending joy will crown their heads.+ Exultation and rejoicing will be theirs,And grief and sighing will flee away.+
