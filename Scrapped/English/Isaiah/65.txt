65  “I have let myself be searched for by those who did not ask for me;I have let myself be found by those who did not look for me.+ I said, ‘Here I am, here I am!’ to a nation that was not calling on my name.+ 
 2  I have spread out my hands all day long to a stubborn people,+To those walking in the way that is not good,+Following their own thoughts;+
 3  A people who constantly offend me to my face,+Sacrificing in gardens+ and making sacrificial smoke on bricks. 
 4  They sit among graves,+And they pass the night in hidden places,*Eating the flesh of pigs,+And the broth of foul* things is in their vessels.+ 
 5  They say, ‘Keep to yourself; do not approach me,For I am holier than you.’* These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire burning all day long. 
 6  Look! It is written before me;I will not stand still,But I will repay them,+I will repay them in full measure*
 7  For their errors and for the errors of their forefathers as well,”+ says Jehovah. “Because they have made sacrificial smoke on the mountainsAnd have reproached me on the hills,+I will first measure out their wages in full.”* 
 8  This is what Jehovah says: “Just as when new wine is found in a cluster of grapesAnd someone says, ‘Do not destroy it, for there is some good* in it,’ So I will do for the sake of my servants;I will not destroy them all.+ 
 9  I will bring out of Jacob an offspring*And out of Judah the one to inherit my mountains;+My chosen ones will take possession of it,And my servants will reside there.+ 
10  Sharʹon+ will become a pasture for sheepAnd the Valley* of Aʹchor+ a resting-place for cattle,For my people who search for me. 
11  But you are among those forsaking Jehovah,+Those forgetting my holy mountain,+Those setting a table for the god of Good Luck,And those filling up cups of mixed wine for the god of Destiny. 
12  So I will destine you for the sword,+And all of you will bow down to be slaughtered,+Because I called, but you did not answer,I spoke, but you did not listen;+You kept doing what was bad in my eyes,And you chose what displeased me.”+ 
13  Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Look! My servants will eat, but you will go hungry.+ Look! My servants will drink,+ but you will go thirsty. Look! My servants will rejoice,+ but you will suffer shame.+ 
14  Look! My servants will shout joyfully because of the good condition of the heart,But you will cry out because of the pain of heartAnd you will wail because of a broken spirit. 
15  You will leave behind a name that my chosen ones will use as a curse,And the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will put each of you to death,But his own servants he will call by another name;+
16  So that anyone who seeks a blessing for himself in the earthWill be blessed by the God of truth,*And anyone who swears an oath in the earthWill swear by the God of truth.*+ For the former distresses* will be forgotten;They will be concealed from my eyes.+ 
17  For look! I am creating new heavens and a new earth;+And the former things will not be called to mind,*Nor will they come up into the heart.+ 
18  So exult and be joyful forever in what I am creating. For look! I am creating Jerusalem a cause for joyAnd her people a cause for exultation.+ 
19  And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and exult in my people;+No more will there be heard in her the sound of weeping or a cry of distress.”+ 
20  “No more will there be an infant from that place who lives but a few days,Nor an old man who fails to live out his days. For anyone who dies at a hundred will be considered a mere boy,And the sinner will be cursed, even though he is a hundred years of age.* 
21  They will build houses and live in them,+And they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.+ 
22  They will not build for someone else to inhabit,Nor will they plant for others to eat. For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,+And the work of their hands my chosen ones will enjoy to the full. 
23  They will not toil* for nothing,*+Nor will they bear children for distress,Because they are the offspring* made up of those blessed by Jehovah,+And their descendants with them.+ 
24  Even before they call out, I will answer;While they are yet speaking, I will hear. 
25  The wolf and the lamb will feed together,The lion will eat straw just like the bull,+And the serpent’s food will be dust. They will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain,”+ says Jehovah.
