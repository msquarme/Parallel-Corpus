13  A pronouncement against Babylon+ that Isaiah+ the son of Aʹmoz saw in vision: 
 2  “Raise up a signal*+ on a mountain of bare rocks. Call out to them, wave your hand,So that they may come into the entrances of the nobles. 
 3  I have issued the command to those whom I have appointed.*+ I have summoned my warriors to express my anger,My proudly exultant ones. 
 4  Listen! A crowd in the mountains;It sounds like a numerous people! Listen! The uproar of kingdoms,Of nations gathered together!+ Jehovah of armies is mustering the army for war.+ 
 5  They are coming from a distant land,+From the extremity of the heavens,Jehovah and the weapons of his wrath,To bring ruin to all the earth.+ 
 6  Wail, for the day of Jehovah is near! It will come as a destruction from the Almighty.+ 
 7  That is why all hands will go limp,And every man’s heart will melt with fear.+ 
 8  The people are panic-stricken.+ They are seized with convulsions and pain,Like a woman in labor. They look at one another in horror,With faces inflamed by anguish. 
 9  Look! The day of Jehovah is coming,Cruel both with fury and with burning anger,To make the land an object of horror,+And to annihilate the land’s sinners from it. 
10  For the stars of the heavens and their constellations*+Will not give off their light;The sun will be dark when it rises,And the moon will not shed its light. 
11  I will call the inhabited earth to account for its badness,+And the wicked for their error. I will put an end to the pride of the presumptuous,And I will humble the haughtiness of tyrants.+ 
12  I will make mortal man scarcer than refined gold,+And humans scarcer than the gold of Oʹphir.+ 
13  That is why I will make the heavens tremble,And the earth will be shaken out of its place+At the fury of Jehovah of armies in the day of his burning anger. 
14  Like a hunted gazelle and like a flock with no one to gather them,Each will return to his own people;Each will flee to his own land.+ 
15  Whoever is found will be pierced through,And whoever is caught will fall by the sword.+ 
16  Their children will be dashed to pieces before their eyes,+Their houses will be looted,And their wives will be raped. 
17  Here I am raising up against them the Medes,+Who regard silver as nothingAnd who take no delight in gold. 
18  Their bows will shatter young men;+They will show no pity on the fruit of the wombNor mercy to children. 
19  And Babylon, the most glorious* of kingdoms,+The beauty and the pride of the Chal·deʹans,+Will be like Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah when God overthrew them.+ 
20  She will never be inhabited,Nor will she be a place to reside in throughout all generations.+ No Arab will pitch his tent there,And no shepherds will rest their flocks there. 
21  The desert creatures will lie down there;Their houses will be filled with eagle owls. The ostriches will reside there,+And wild goats* will skip about there. 
22  Howling creatures will cry out in her towers,And jackals in her luxurious palaces. Her time is near, and her days will not be prolonged.”+
