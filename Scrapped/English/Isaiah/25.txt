25  O Jehovah, you are my God. I exalt you, I praise your name,For you have done wonderful things,+Things purposed* from ancient times,+In faithfulness,+ in trustworthiness. 
 2  For you have turned a city into a pile of stones,A fortified town into a crumbling ruin. The foreigner’s tower is a city no more;It will never be rebuilt. 
 3  That is why a strong people will glorify you;The city of tyrannical nations will fear you.+ 
 4  For you have become a stronghold to the lowly,A stronghold to the poor in his distress,+A refuge from the rainstorm,And a shade from the heat.+ When the blast of the tyrants is like a rainstorm against a wall,
 5  As the heat in a parched land,You subdue the uproar of strangers. Like heat is subdued by the shadow of a cloud,So the song of the tyrants is silenced. 
 6  In this mountain+ Jehovah of armies will make for all the peoplesA banquet of rich dishes,+A banquet of fine wine,*Of rich dishes filled with marrow,Of fine, filtered wine. 
 7  In this mountain he will do away with* the shroud that is enveloping all the peoplesAnd the covering* that is woven over all the nations. 
 8  He will swallow up* death forever,+And the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces.+ The reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth,For Jehovah himself has spoken it. 
 9  In that day they will say: “Look! This is our God!+ We have hoped in him,+And he will save us.+ This is Jehovah! We have hoped in him. Let us be joyful and rejoice in the salvation by him.”+ 
10  For the hand of Jehovah will rest on this mountain,+And Moʹab will be trampled on in its place+Like straw trampled into a pile of manure. 
11  He will slap out his hands into itLike a swimmer slapping out his hands to swim,And he will bring down its haughtiness+With the skillful movements of his hands. 
12  And the fortified city, with your high walls of security,He will bring down;He will knock it down to the ground, to the very dust.
