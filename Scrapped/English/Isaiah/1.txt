1  The vision that Isaiah*+ the son of Aʹmoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uz·ziʹah,+ Joʹtham,+ Aʹhaz,+ and Hez·e·kiʹah,+ kings of Judah:+ 
 2  Hear, O heavens, and pay attention, O earth,+For Jehovah has spoken: “Sons I have brought up and raised,+But they have revolted against me.+ 
 3  A bull well knows its buyer,And a donkey the manger of its owner;But Israel does not know me,*+My own people do not behave with understanding.” 
 4  Woe to the sinful nation,+The people weighed down with error,A brood of wicked men, corrupt children! They have abandoned Jehovah;+They have treated the Holy One of Israel with disrespect;They have turned their backs on him. 
 5  Where will you be struck next as you add to your rebellion?+ The whole head is sick,And the whole heart is diseased.+ 
 6  From the sole of the foot to the head, nothing is healthy. There are wounds and bruises and open sores—They have not been treated* or bound up or softened with oil.+ 
 7  Your land is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Foreigners devour your land right in front of you.+ It is like a wasteland overthrown by foreigners.+ 
 8  The daughter of Zion has been left like a shelter* in a vineyard,Like a hut in a cucumber field,Like a city under siege.+ 
 9  Unless Jehovah of armies had left us a few survivors,We should have become just like Sodʹom,And we should have resembled Go·morʹrah.+ 
10  Hear the word of Jehovah, you dictators* of Sodʹom.+ Pay attention to the law* of our God, you people of Go·morʹrah.+ 
11  “Of what benefit to me are your many sacrifices?”+ says Jehovah. “I have had enough of your burnt offerings of rams+ and the fat of well-fed animals,+And I have no delight in the blood+ of young bulls+ and lambs and goats.+ 
12  When you come to appear before me,+Who has required this from you,This trampling of my courtyards?+ 
13  Stop bringing in any more worthless grain offerings. Your incense is detestable to me.+ New moons,+ sabbaths,+ the calling of conventions+—I cannot put up with the use of magical power+ along with your solemn assembly. 
14  I have* hated your new moons and your festivals. They have become a burden to me;I am tired of bearing them. 
15  And when you spread out your palms,I hide my eyes from you.+ Although you offer many prayers,+I am not listening;+Your hands are filled with blood.+ 
16  Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean;+Remove your evil deeds from my sight;Stop doing bad.+ 
17  Learn to do good, seek justice,+Correct the oppressor,Defend the rights of the fatherless child,*And plead the cause of the widow.”+ 
18  “Come, now, and let us set matters straight between us,” says Jehovah.+ “Though your sins are like scarlet,They will be made as white as snow;+Though they are as red as crimson cloth,They will become like wool. 
19  If you show willingness and listen,You will eat the good things of the land.+ 
20  But if you refuse and rebel,You will be devoured by the sword,+For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken it.” 
21  How the faithful city+ has become a prostitute!+ She was full of justice;+Righteousness used to lodge in her,+But now murderers.+ 
22  Your silver has become dross,+And your beer* is diluted with water. 
23  Your princes are stubborn and partners with thieves.+ Every one of them loves a bribe and chases after gifts.+ They do not grant justice to the fatherless,*And the legal case of the widow never reaches them.+ 
24  Therefore the true Lord, Jehovah of armies,The Powerful One of Israel, declares: “Ah! I will rid myself of my adversaries,And I will take revenge on my enemies.+ 
25  I will turn my hand against you,I will smelt away your dross as with lye,And I will remove all your impurities.+ 
26  I will restore your judges as in the beginningAnd your advisers as at the start.+ After this you will be called City of Righteousness, Faithful Town.+ 
27  With justice Zion will be redeemed,+And her people who return, with righteousness. 
28  The rebels and the sinners will be broken together,+And those leaving Jehovah will come to their finish.+ 
29  For they will be ashamed of the mighty trees that you desired,+And you will be disgraced because of the gardens* that you chose.+ 
30  For you will become like a big tree with withering leaves,+And like a garden without water. 
31  The strong man will become tow,*And his work a spark;Both of them will go up in flames together,With no one to extinguish them.”
