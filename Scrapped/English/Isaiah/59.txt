59  Look! The hand of Jehovah is not too short to save,+Nor is his ear too dull* to hear.+ 
 2  No, your own errors have separated you from your God.+ Your sins have made him hide his face from you,And he refuses to hear you.+ 
 3  For your palms are polluted with blood+And your fingers with error. Your lips speak lies,+ and your tongue mutters unrighteousness. 
 4  No one calls out for righteousness,+And no one goes to court in truthfulness. They trust in unreality*+ and speak what is worthless. They conceive trouble and give birth to what is harmful.+ 
 5  They hatch the eggs of a poisonous snake,And they weave the cobweb of a spider.+ Anyone who eats their eggs would die,And the egg that is crushed hatches a viper. 
 6  Their cobweb will not serve as a garment,Nor will they cover themselves with what they make.+ Their works are harmful,And deeds of violence are in their hands.+ 
 7  Their feet run to do evil,And they hurry to shed innocent blood.+ Their thoughts are harmful thoughts;Ruin and misery are in their ways.+ 
 8  They have not known the way of peace,And there is no justice in their tracks.+ They make their roadways crooked;No one treading on them will know peace.+ 
 9  That is why justice is far away from us,And righteousness does not overtake us. We keep hoping for light, but look! there is darkness;For brightness, but we keep walking in gloom.+ 
10  We grope for the wall like blind men;Like those without eyes we keep groping.+ We stumble at high noon as in evening darkness;Among the strong we are just like the dead. 
11  We all keep growling like bearsAnd cooing mournfully like doves. We hope for justice, but there is none;For salvation, but it is far away from us. 
12  For our revolts are many before you;+Each of our sins testifies against us.+ For our revolts are with us;We well know our errors.+ 
13  We have transgressed and denied Jehovah;We have turned our backs on our God. We have spoken of oppression and revolt;+We have conceived lies and muttered false words from the heart.+ 
14  Justice is driven back,+And righteousness stands far off;+For truth* has stumbled in the public square,And what is upright is unable to enter. 
15  Truth* has vanished,+And anyone who turns away from bad is plundered. Jehovah saw this and was displeased,*For there was no justice.+ 
16  He saw that there was no man,And he was astonished that no one interceded,So his own arm brought about salvation,*And his own righteousness supported him. 
17  Then he put on righteousness like a coat of mailAnd the helmet of salvation* on his head.+ He put on the garments of vengeance as his clothing+And wrapped himself with zeal like a coat.* 
18  He will reward them for what they have done:+ Wrath to his adversaries, retribution to his enemies.+ And to the islands he will repay their due. 
19  From the sunset they will fear the name of JehovahAnd from the sunrise his glory,For he will come in like a rushing river,Which the spirit of Jehovah drives along. 
20  “To Zion the Repurchaser+ will come,+To those in Jacob who turn from transgression,”+ declares Jehovah. 
21  “As for me, this is my covenant with them,”+ says Jehovah. “My spirit that is on you and my words that I have placed in your mouth—they will not be removed from your mouth, from the mouth of your children,* or from the mouth of your grandchildren,”* says Jehovah, “from now on and forever.”
