48  Hear this, O house of Jacob,You who call yourselves by the name of Israel+And who have come from the waters of* Judah,You who swear by the name of Jehovah+And who call on the God of Israel,Though not in truth and righteousness.+ 
 2  For they call themselves after the holy city+And seek the support of the God of Israel,+Whose name is Jehovah of armies. 
 3  “The former* things I told you long ago. From my own mouth they went out,And I made them known.+ Suddenly I took action, and they came about.+ 
 4  Because I knew how stubborn you are—That your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead is copper+—
 5  I told you long ago. Before it came about, I caused you to hear it,So that you could not say, ‘My idol did this;My carved image and my metal image* commanded this.’ 
 6  You have heard and seen all of this. Will you not declare it?+ From now on I am announcing new things to you,+Guarded secrets that you have not known. 
 7  Only now are they being created, and not long ago,Things that you never heard before today,So that you cannot say, ‘Look! I already know them.’ 
 8  No, you have not heard,+ you have not known,And in the past your ears were not opened. For I know that you are very treacherous,+And you have been called a transgressor from birth.+ 
 9  But for the sake of my name I will hold back my anger;+For my own praise I will restrain myself toward you,And I will not do away with you.+ 
10  Look! I have refined you, but not in the form of silver.+ I have tested* you in the smelting furnace of affliction.+ 
11  For my own sake, for my own sake I will act,+For how could I let myself be profaned?+ I give my glory to no one else.* 
12  Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I have called. I am the same One.+ I am the first; I am also the last.+ 
13  My own hand laid the foundation of the earth,+And my right hand spread out the heavens.+ When I call to them, they stand up together. 
14  Gather together, all of you, and listen. Who among them has announced these things? Jehovah has loved him.+ He will carry out his delight against Babylon,+And his arm will come against the Chal·deʹans.+ 
15  I myself have spoken, and I have called him.+ I have brought him, and his way will be successful.+ 
16  Come near to me, and hear this. From the very start I have not spoken in secret.+ From the time it happened I was there.” And now the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has sent me, and* his spirit. 
17  This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel:+ “I, Jehovah, am your God,The One teaching you to benefit yourself,*+The One guiding you in the way you should walk.+ 
18  If only you would pay attention to my commandments!+ Then your peace would become just like a river+And your righteousness like the waves of the sea.+ 
19  Your offspring* would be as many as the sandAnd your descendants as its grains.+ Their name would never be cut off or annihilated from before me.” 
20  Go out from Babylon!+ Flee from the Chal·deʹans! Announce it with a joyful cry! Proclaim it!+ Make it known to the ends of the earth.+ Say: “Jehovah has repurchased his servant Jacob.+ 
21  They did not become thirsty when he led them through devastated places.+ He caused water to flow out of the rock for them;He split a rock and made water gush out.”+ 
22  “There is no peace,” says Jehovah, “for the wicked.”+
