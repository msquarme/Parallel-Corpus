41  “Listen to me in silence,* you islands;Let the nations regain their strength. Let them approach; then let them speak.+ Let us come together for judgment. 
 2  Who has raised up someone from the sunrise,*+Calling him in righteousness to His feet,*To hand over nations to himAnd to make him subdue kings?+ Who reduces them to dust before his sword,Like windblown stubble before his bow? 
 3  He pursues them, passing along unhinderedOver paths that his feet have not traveled. 
 4  Who has acted and done this,Summoning the generations from the beginning? I, Jehovah, am the First One;+And with the last ones I am the same.”+ 
 5  The islands have seen it and have become afraid. The ends of the earth began to tremble. They draw near and come forward. 
 6  Each one helps his companionAnd says to his brother: “Be strong.” 
 7  So the craftsman strengthens the metalworker;+The one who flattens with the forge hammerStrengthens the one hammering at the anvil. He says about the soldering: “It is good.” Then it is fastened with nails so that it will not topple over. 
 8  “But you, O Israel, are my servant,+You, O Jacob, whom I have chosen,+The offspring* of Abraham my friend,+
 9  You, whom I took from the ends of the earth,+And you, whom I called from its most distant parts. I said to you, ‘You are my servant;+I have chosen you; I have not rejected you.+ 
10  Do not be afraid, for I am with you.+ Do not be anxious, for I am your God.+ I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,+I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.’ 
11  Look! All those getting enraged against you will be put to shame and humiliated.+ Those who fight with you will be brought to nothing and perish.+ 
12  You will search for men who struggle with you, but you will not find them;The men at war with you will become as something nonexistent, as nothing at all.+ 
13  For I, Jehovah your God, am grasping your right hand,The One saying to you, ‘Do not be afraid. I will help you.’+ 
14  Do not be afraid, you worm* Jacob,+You men of Israel, I will help you,” declares Jehovah, your Repurchaser,+ the Holy One of Israel. 
15  “Look! I have made you a threshing sledge,+A new threshing instrument with double-edged teeth. You will tread down the mountains and crush themAnd make the hills like chaff. 
16  You will winnow them,And the wind will carry them away;A windstorm will scatter them. You will be joyful in Jehovah,+And you will boast in the Holy One of Israel.”+ 
17  “The needy and the poor are seeking water, but there is none. Their tongue is dry from thirst.+ I, Jehovah, will answer them.+ I, the God of Israel, will not abandon them.+ 
18  I will make rivers flow on the bare hills+And springs in the valley plains.+ I will turn the wilderness into a reedy pool of waterAnd the waterless land into springs of water.+ 
19  In the desert I will plant the cedar tree,The acacia and the myrtle and the pine tree.+ In the desert plain I will plant the juniper tree,Together with the ash and the cypress tree,+
20  So that all people may see and knowAnd pay attention and understandThat the hand of Jehovah has done this,And the Holy One of Israel has created it.”+ 
21  “Present your case,” says Jehovah. “Produce your arguments,” says the King of Jacob. 
22  “Produce evidence and tell us the things that will happen. Do tell us about the former* things,So that we may reflect on them* and know their outcome. Or declare to us the things that are coming.+ 
23  Tell us what will happen in the future,So that we may know that you are gods.+ Yes, do something, good or bad,So that we may be amazed when we see it.+ 
24  Look! You are something nonexistent,And your achievement is nothing.+ Anyone who chooses you is detestable.+ 
25  I have raised up someone from the north, and he will come,+One from the rising of the sun*+ who will call on my name. He will trample rulers* as if they were clay,+Like a potter who treads moist clay. 
26  Who told about this from the beginning, so that we could know,Or from times past, so that we could say, ‘He is right’?+ Indeed, no one announced it! No one declared it! No one heard anything from you!”+ 
27  I was the first to say to Zion: “Look! Here they are!”+ And to Jerusalem I will send a bearer of good news.+ 
28  But I kept looking, and there was no one;There was not one among them to give advice. And I kept asking them to reply. 
29  Look! All of them are a delusion.* Their works are nothing. Their metal images* are wind and unreality.+
