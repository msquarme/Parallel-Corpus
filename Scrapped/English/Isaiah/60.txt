60  “Arise, O woman,+ shed light, for your light has come. The glory of Jehovah shines on you.+ 
 2  For look! darkness will cover the earthAnd thick gloom the nations;But on you Jehovah will shine,And on you his glory will be seen. 
 3  Nations will go to your light+And kings+ to your shining splendor.*+ 
 4  Raise your eyes and look all around you! They have all been assembled; they are coming to you. From far away your sons keep coming,+And your daughters being supported on the hip.+ 
 5  At that time you will see and become radiant,+And your heart will throb and overflow,Because the wealth of the sea will be directed to you;The resources of the nations will come to you.+ 
 6  Throngs of camels will cover your land,*Young male camels of Midʹi·an and Eʹphah.+ All those from Sheʹba—they will come;Gold and frankincense they will carry. They will proclaim the praises of Jehovah.+ 
 7  All the flocks of Keʹdar+ will be gathered to you. The rams of Ne·baʹioth+ will serve you. They will come on my altar with approval,+And I will beautify my glorious house.*+ 
 8  Who are these that fly along like clouds,Like doves to their dovecotes?* 
 9  For in me the islands will hope;+The ships of Tarʹshish are in the lead,*To bring your sons from far away,+Along with their silver and their gold,To the name of Jehovah your God and to the Holy One of Israel,For he will glorify* you.+ 
10  Foreigners will build your walls,And their kings will minister to you,+For in my indignation I struck you,But in my favor* I will have mercy on you.+ 
11  Your gates will be kept open constantly;+They will not be closed by day or by night,To bring to you the resources of the nations,And their kings will take the lead.+ 
12  For any nation and any kingdom that will not serve you will perish,And the nations will be utterly devastated.+ 
13  To you the glory of Lebʹa·non will come,+The juniper tree, the ash tree, and the cypress together,+To beautify the place of my sanctuary;I will glorify the place for my feet.+ 
14  The sons of those who oppressed you will come and bow down before you;All those treating you disrespectfully must bow down at your feet,And they will have to call you the city of Jehovah,Zion of the Holy One of Israel.+ 
15  Instead of your being abandoned and hated, with nobody passing through,+I will make you a source of everlasting pride,A cause for rejoicing throughout all generations.+ 
16  And you will actually drink the milk of nations,+At the breast of kings you will nurse;+And you will certainly know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior,And the Powerful One of Jacob is your Repurchaser.+ 
17  Instead of the copper I will bring in gold,And instead of the iron I will bring in silver,Instead of the wood, copper,And instead of the stones, iron;And I will appoint peace as your overseersAnd righteousness as your task assigners.+ 
18  No more will violence be heard in your landOr destruction and ruin within your boundaries.+ And you will call your walls Salvation+ and your gates Praise. 
19  For you the sun will no longer be a light by day,Nor will the shining of the moon give you light,For Jehovah will become to you an eternal light,+And your God will be your beauty.+ 
20  No more will your sun set,Nor will your moon wane,For Jehovah will become for you an eternal light,+And the days of your mourning will have ended.+ 
21  And all your people will be righteous;They will possess the land forever. They are the sprout that I planted,The work of my hands,+ for me to be beautified.+ 
22  The little one will become a thousandAnd the small one a mighty nation. I myself, Jehovah, will speed it up in its own time.”
