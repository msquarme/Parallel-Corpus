31  Woe to those who go down to Egypt for assistance,+Who rely on horses,+Who trust in war chariots because they are numerous,And in warhorses* because they are mighty. But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel,And they do not search for Jehovah. 
 2  But he is also wise and will bring calamity,And he will not take back his words. He will rise up against the house of evildoersAnd against those who help wrongdoers.+ 
 3  The Egyptians, though, are mere men and not God;Their horses are flesh and not spirit.+ When Jehovah stretches out his hand,Whoever offers help will stumbleAnd whoever is helped will fall;They will all perish at the same time. 
 4  For this is what Jehovah has said to me: “Just as the lion growls, a strong young lion,* over its prey,When a whole group of shepherds is called together against it,And it is not terrified by their voiceOr daunted by their commotion,So will Jehovah of armies come down to wage warOver Mount Zion and over her hill. 
 5  Like swooping birds, so Jehovah of armies will defend Jerusalem.+ He will defend her and save her. He will spare her and rescue her.” 
6  “Return to the One against whom you have blatantly revolted, O people of Israel.+
7  For in that day each one will reject his worthless gods of silver and his valueless gods of gold, which your own hands sinfully made. 
 8  And the As·syrʹi·an will fall by the sword, not of a man;And a sword, not of a human, will devour him.+ He will flee because of the sword,And his young men will be put to forced labor. 
 9  His crag will pass away because of sheer fright,And his princes will be terrified because of the signal pole,” declares Jehovah,Whose light* is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
