50  This is what Jehovah says: “Where is the divorce certificate+ of your mother, whom I sent away? Or to which of my creditors did I sell you? Look! It was because of your own errors+ you were sold,And because of your own transgressions your mother was sent away.+ 
 2  Why, then, was no one here when I came? Why did no one answer when I called?+ Is my hand too short to redeem,Or is there no power in me to rescue?+ Look! With my rebuke I dry up the sea;+I make rivers a desert.+ Their fish rot for lack of water,And they die because of thirst. 
 3  I clothe the heavens with gloom,+And I make sackcloth their covering.” 
 4  The Sovereign Lord Jehovah has given me the tongue of those taught,*+So that I may know how to answer* the tired one with the right word.*+ He awakens me morning by morning;He awakens my ear to listen like the taught ones.+ 
 5  The Sovereign Lord Jehovah has opened my ear,And I was not rebellious.+ I did not turn in the opposite direction.+ 
 6  I offered my back to those striking meAnd my cheeks to those who plucked them bare.* I did not hide my face from humiliating things and from spit.+ 
 7  But the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will help me.+ That is why I will not feel humiliated. That is why I have set my face like a flint,+And I know that I will not be put to shame. 
 8  The One who declares me righteous is near. Who can accuse* me?+ Let us stand up together.* Who has a case against me? Let him approach me. 
 9  Look! The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will help me. Who will pronounce me guilty? Look! They will all wear out like a garment. A moth will eat them up. 
10  Who among you fears JehovahAnd listens to the voice of his servant?+ Who has walked in deep darkness, without any brightness? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah and support himself on* his God. 
11  “Look! All of you who are igniting a fire,Making sparks fly,Walk in the light of your fire,Among the sparks you have set ablaze. This is what you will have from my hand: In sheer pain you will lie down.
