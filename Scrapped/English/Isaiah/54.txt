54  “Shout joyfully, you barren woman who has not given birth!+ Become cheerful and cry out for joy,+ you who never had birth pains,+For the sons* of the desolate one are more numerousThan the sons of the woman with a husband,”*+ says Jehovah. 
 2  “Make the place of your tent more spacious.+ Stretch out the tent cloths of your grand tabernacle. Do not hold back, lengthen your tent cords,And make your tent pins strong.+ 
 3  For you will spread out to the right and to the left. Your offspring will take possession of nations,And they will inhabit the desolated cities.+ 
 4  Do not be afraid,+ for you will not be put to shame;+And do not feel humiliated, for you will not be disappointed. For you will forget the shame of your youth,And the disgrace of your widowhood you will remember no more.” 
 5  “For your Grand Maker+ is as your husband,*+Jehovah of armies is his name,And the Holy One of Israel is your Repurchaser.+ He will be called the God of the whole earth.+ 
 6  For Jehovah called you as if you were an abandoned wife and grief-stricken,*+Like a wife married in youth and then rejected,” says your God. 
 7  “For a brief moment I abandoned you,But with great mercy I will gather you back.+ 
 8  In a flood of indignation I hid my face from you for a moment,+But with everlasting loyal love I will have mercy on you,”+ says your Repurchaser,+ Jehovah. 
 9  “This is like the days of Noah to me.+ Just as I have sworn that the waters of Noah will no more cover the earth,+So I swear that I will no more become indignant toward you or rebuke you.+ 
10  For the mountains may be removedAnd the hills may be shaken,But my loyal love will not be removed from you,+Nor will my covenant of peace be shaken,”+ says Jehovah, the One having mercy on you.+ 
11  “O afflicted woman,+ storm-tossed, uncomforted,+I am laying your stones with hard mortarAnd your foundation with sapphires.+ 
12  I will make your battlements of rubies,Your gates of sparkling stones,*And all your boundaries of precious stones. 
13  And all your sons* will be taught by Jehovah,+And the peace of your sons* will be abundant.+ 
14  You will be firmly established in righteousness.+ You will be far removed from oppression,+You will fear nothing and have no cause for terror,For it will not come near you.+ 
15  If anyone should attack you,It will not be at my orders. Whoever makes an attack on you will fall because of you.”+ 
16  “Look! I myself created the craftsman,Who blows on the charcoal fire,And his work produces a weapon. I myself also created the destructive man to bring ruin.+ 
17  No weapon formed against you will have any success,+And you will condemn any tongue that rises up against you in the judgment. This is the heritage* of the servants of Jehovah,And their righteousness is from me,” declares Jehovah.+
