15  A pronouncement against Moʹab:+ Because it has been devastated in a night,Ar+ of Moʹab has been silenced. Because it has been devastated in a night,Kir+ of Moʹab has been silenced. 
 2  He has gone up to the House* and to Diʹbon,+To the high places to weep. Moʹab wails over Neʹbo+ and over Medʹe·ba.+ Every head is shaved bald,+ every beard is clipped.+ 
 3  In its streets they have put on sackcloth. On their roofs and in their public squares they all wail;They go down weeping.+ 
 4  Heshʹbon and E·le·aʹleh+ cry out;Their voice is heard as far as Jaʹhaz.+ That is why the armed men of Moʹab keep shouting. He* is trembling. 
 5  My heart cries out over Moʹab. Its fugitives have fled as far as Zoʹar+ and Egʹlath-she·liʹshi·yah.+ On the ascent of Luʹhith they weep as they go up;On the way to Hor·o·naʹim they cry out over the catastrophe.+ 
 6  For the waters of Nimʹrim are desolate;The green grass has dried up,The grass is gone and nothing green is left. 
 7  That is why they are carrying away what is left of their stores and their riches;They are crossing the valley* of poplars. 
 8  For the outcry echoes throughout the territory of Moʹab.+ The wailing reaches to Eg·laʹim;The wailing reaches to Beʹer-eʹlim. 
 9  For the waters of Diʹmon are full of blood,And I have more in store for Diʹmon: A lion for those of Moʹab who escapeAnd for those remaining in the land.+
