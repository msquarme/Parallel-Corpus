43  Now this is what Jehovah says,Your Creator, O Jacob, the One who formed you, O Israel:+ “Do not be afraid, for I have repurchased you.+ I have called you by your name. You belong to me. 
 2  When you pass through the waters, I will be with you,+And through the rivers, they will not flood over you.+ When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched,Nor will the flame singe you. 
 3  For I am Jehovah your God,The Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I have given Egypt as a ransom for you,E·thi·oʹpi·a and Seʹba in exchange for you. 
 4  For you became precious in my eyes,+You were honored, and I have loved you.+ So I will give people in place of youAnd nations in exchange for your life.* 
 5  Do not be afraid, for I am with you.+ I will bring your offspring* from the eastAnd gather you together from the west.+ 
 6  I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’+ And to the south, ‘Do not hold them back. Bring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the ends of the earth,+
 7  Everyone who is called by my name+And whom I created for my own glory,Whom I have formed and made.’+ 
 8  Bring out a people who are blind, though they have eyes,And who are deaf, though they have ears.+ 
 9  Let all the nations assemble in one place,And let the peoples be gathered together.+ Who among them can tell this? Or can they cause us to hear the first things?*+ Let them present their witnesses to prove themselves right,Or let them hear and say, ‘It is the truth!’”+ 
10  “You are my witnesses,”+ declares Jehovah,“Yes, my servant whom I have chosen,+So that you may know and have faith in me*And understand that I am the same One.+ Before me no God was formed,And after me there has been none.+ 
11  I—I am Jehovah,+ and besides me there is no savior.”+ 
12  “I am the One who declared and saved and made knownWhen there was no foreign god among you.+ So you are my witnesses,” declares Jehovah, “and I am God.+ 
13  Also, I am always the same One;+And no one can snatch anything out of my hand.+ When I act, who can prevent it?”+ 
14  This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser,+ the Holy One of Israel:+ “For your sakes I will send to Babylon and bring down all the bars of the gates,+And the Chal·deʹans, in their ships, will cry out in distress.+ 
15  I am Jehovah, your Holy One,+ the Creator of Israel,+ your King.”+ 
16  This is what Jehovah says,The One making a way through the seaAnd a path even through turbulent waters,+
17  The One who draws out the war chariot and the horse,+The army together with the mighty warriors: “They will lie down and not get up.+ They will be extinguished, snuffed out like a burning wick.” 
18  “Do not remember the former things,And do not dwell on the past. 
19  Look! I am doing something new;+Even now it is springing up. Do you not recognize it? I will make a way through the wilderness+And rivers through the desert.+ 
20  The wild beast of the field will honor me,The jackals and the ostriches,For I provide water in the wilderness,Rivers in the desert,+For my people, my chosen one,+ to drink,
21  The people whom I formed for myselfSo that they might declare my praise.+ 
22  But you have not called on me, O Jacob,+Because you grew weary of me, O Israel.+ 
23  You have not brought me sheep for your whole burnt offeringsOr glorified me with your sacrifices. I have not compelled you to bring me a gift,Nor have I made you weary by demanding frankincense.+ 
24  You did not buy me sweet cane* with your money,And with the fat of your sacrifices you did not satisfy me.+ Instead, you have burdened me with your sinsAnd made me weary with your errors.+ 
25  I, I am the One who is blotting out your transgressions*+ for my own sake,+And I will not remember your sins.+ 
26  Remind me; let us bring our case against each other;Tell your side of it to prove you are in the right. 
27  Your first forefather sinned,And your own spokesmen* have rebelled against me.+ 
28  So I will profane the princes of the holy place,And I will give Jacob over to destructionAnd subject Israel to insulting words.+
