11  A twig+ will grow out of the stump of Jesʹse,+And a sprout+ from his roots will bear fruit. 
 2  And the spirit of Jehovah will settle upon him,+The spirit of wisdom+ and of understanding,The spirit of counsel and of mightiness,+The spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah. 
 3  And he will find delight in the fear of Jehovah.+ He will not judge by what appears to his eyes,Nor reprove simply according to what his ears hear.+ 
 4  He will judge the lowly with fairness,*And with uprightness he will give reproof in behalf of the meek ones of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth+And put the wicked to death with the breath* of his lips.+ 
 5  Righteousness will be the belt around his waist,And faithfulness the belt of his hips.+ 
 6  The wolf will reside for a while with the lamb,+And with the young goat the leopard will lie down,And the calf and the lion* and the fattened animal will all be together;*+And a little boy will lead them. 
 7  The cow and the bear will feed together,And their young will lie down together. The lion will eat straw like the bull.+ 
 8  The nursing child will play over the lair of a cobra,And a weaned child will put his hand over the den of a poisonous snake. 
 9  They will not cause any harm+Or any ruin in all my holy mountain,+Because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of JehovahAs the waters cover the sea.+ 
10  In that day the root of Jesʹse+ will stand up as a signal* for the peoples.+ To him the nations will turn for guidance,*+And his resting-place will become glorious. 
11  In that day Jehovah will again offer his hand, a second time, to reclaim the remnant of his people who are left from As·syrʹi·a,+ from Egypt,+ from Pathʹros,+ from Cush,+ from Eʹlam,+ from Shiʹnar,* from Haʹmath, and from the islands of the sea.+
12  He will raise up a signal* for the nations and gather the dispersed ones of Israel,+ and he will gather together the scattered ones of Judah from the four corners of the earth.+ 
13  The jealousy of Eʹphra·im will be gone,+And those who show hostility to Judah will be done away with. Eʹphra·im will not be jealous of Judah,Nor will Judah show hostility toward Eʹphra·im.+ 
14  And they will swoop down on the slopes* of the Phi·lisʹtines to the west;Together they will plunder the people of the East. They will thrust out their hand against* Eʹdom+ and Moʹab,+And the Amʹmon·ites will become their subjects.+ 
15  Jehovah will divide* the gulf* of the Egyptian sea+And wave his hand over the River.*+ With his scorching breath* he will strike it in its* seven torrents,And he will cause people to walk across in their sandals. 
16  And there will be a highway+ out of As·syrʹi·a for the remnant of his people who are left,+As there was for Israel in the day he came out of the land of Egypt.
