27  In that day Jehovah, with his harsh and great and strong sword,+Will turn his attention to Le·viʹa·than,* the gliding serpent,To Le·viʹa·than, the twisting serpent,And he will kill the monster that is in the sea. 
 2  In that day sing to her:* “A vineyard of foaming wine!+ 
 3  I, Jehovah, am safeguarding her.+ Every moment I water her.+ I safeguard her night and day,So that no one may harm her.+ 
 4  There is no wrath in me.+ Who will confront me with thornbushes and weeds in the battle? I will trample them and set them on fire all together. 
 5  Otherwise, let him hold fast to my stronghold. Let him make peace with me;Peace let him make with me.” 
 6  In the coming days Jacob will take root,Israel will blossom and sprout,+And they will fill the land with produce.+ 
 7  Must he be struck with the stroke of the one striking him? Or must he be killed as with the slaughter of his slain? 
 8  With a startling cry you will contend with her when sending her away. He will expel her with his fierce blast in the day of the east wind.+ 
 9  So in this way the error of Jacob will be atoned for,+And this will be the full fruitage when his sin is taken away: He will make all the stones of the altarLike chalkstones that have been pulverized,And no sacred poles* or incense stands will be left.+ 
10  For the fortified city will be deserted;The pastures will be forsaken and abandoned like a wilderness.+ There the calf will graze and lie downAnd will consume her branches.+ 
11  When her twigs have dried up,Women will come and break them off,Making fires with them. For this people is without understanding.+ That is why their Maker will show them no mercy,And the One who formed them will show them no favor.+ 
12  In that day Jehovah will beat out the fruit from the flowing stream of the River* to the Wadi* of Egypt,+ and you will be gathered up one after the other, O people of Israel.+
13  In that day a great horn will be blown,+ and those who are perishing in the land of As·syrʹi·a+ and those dispersed in the land of Egypt+ will come and bow down to Jehovah in the holy mountain in Jerusalem.+
