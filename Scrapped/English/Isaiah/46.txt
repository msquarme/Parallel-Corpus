46  Bel bends down,+ Neʹbo stoops over. Their idols are loaded on animals, on beasts of burden,+Like baggage that burdens the weary animals. 
 2  They stoop and bend down together;They cannot rescue the loads,*And they themselves* go into captivity. 
 3  “Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all you who remain of the house of Israel,+You whom I have supported from birth and carried from the womb.+ 
 4  Until you grow old I will be the same;+Until your hair is gray I will keep bearing you. As I have done, I will carry you and bear you and rescue you.+ 
 5  To whom will you liken me or make me equal or compare me,+So that we should resemble each other?+ 
 6  There are those who lavish gold from their purse;They weigh out the silver on the scale. They hire a metalworker, and he makes it into a god.+ Then they prostrate themselves, yes, they worship it.*+ 
 7  They lift it to their shoulders;+They carry it and put it in its place, and it just stands there. It does not move from its place.+ They cry out to it, but it does not answer;It cannot rescue anyone from distress.+ 
 8  Remember this, and take courage. Take it to heart, you transgressors. 
 9  Remember the former* things of long ago,That I am God,* and there is no other. I am God, and there is no one like me.+ 
10  From the beginning I foretell the outcome,And from long ago the things that have not yet been done.+ I say, ‘My decision* will stand,+And I will do whatever I please.’+ 
11  I am calling a bird of prey from the sunrise,*+From a distant land the man to carry out my decision.*+ I have spoken, and I will bring it about. I have purposed it, and I will also carry it out.+ 
12  Listen to me, you who are stubborn* of heart,You who are far away from righteousness. 
13  I have brought my righteousness near;It is not far away,And my salvation will not delay.+ I will grant salvation in Zion, my splendor to Israel.”+
