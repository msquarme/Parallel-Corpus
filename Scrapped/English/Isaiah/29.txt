29  “Woe to Arʹi·el,* Arʹi·el, the city where David encamped!+ Continue year after year;Let the cycle of festivals+ continue. 
 2  But I will bring distress on Arʹi·el,+And there will be mourning and lamentation,+And she will become to me like an altar hearth of God.+ 
 3  I will encamp on all sides against you,And I will besiege you with a palisadeAnd raise up siegeworks against you.+ 
 4  You will be brought low;From the ground you will speak,And what you say will be muffled by dust. Your voice will come from the ground+Like the voice of a spirit medium,And your words will chirp from the dust. 
 5  The crowd of your enemies* will be like fine powder,+The crowd of the tyrants just like the blowing chaff.+ And it will happen in an instant, suddenly.+ 
 6  Jehovah of armies will give you his attentionWith thunder and earthquake and a great noise,With storm wind and tempest and the flames of a consuming fire.”+ 
 7  Then the crowd of all the nations waging war against Arʹi·el+—All those waging war against her,The siege towers against her,And those bringing distress on her—Will become like a dream, a vision of the night. 
 8  Yes, it will be just as when someone hungry dreams that he is eating,But he wakes up hungry,*And as when someone thirsty dreams that he is drinking,But he wakes up tired and thirsty.* So it will happen with the crowd of all the nationsThat wage war against Mount Zion.+ 
 9  Be stunned and amazed;+Blind yourselves and be blinded.+ They are drunk, but not with wine;They are staggering, but not from alcohol. 
10  For Jehovah has poured a spirit of deep sleep on you;+He has closed your eyes, the prophets,+And he has covered your heads, the visionaries.+ 
11  Every vision becomes for you like the words of a sealed book.+ When they give it to someone who can read, saying: “Read this out loud, please,” he will say: “I cannot, for it is sealed up.”
12  And when they give the book to someone who cannot read, saying: “Read this, please,” he will say: “I cannot read at all.” 
13  Jehovah says: “This people approaches me with their mouthAnd they honor me with their lips,+But their heart is far removed from me;And their fear of me is based on commands of men that they have been taught.+ 
14  Therefore, I am the One who will again do wonderful things with this people,+With wonder upon wonder;And the wisdom of their wise men will perish,And the understanding of their discreet men will be hidden.”+ 
15  Woe to those who go to great lengths to conceal their plans* from Jehovah.+ Their deeds are done in a dark place,While they say: “Who sees us? Who knows about us?”+ 
16  How you twist things!* Should the potter be regarded the same as the clay?+ Should what is made say about its maker: “He did not make me”?+ And does what is formed say about its former: “He shows no understanding”?+ 
17  In just a short time, Lebʹa·non will be turned into an orchard,+And the orchard will be regarded as a forest.+ 
18  In that day the deaf will hear the words of the book,And out of the gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.+ 
19  The meek will rejoice greatly in Jehovah,And the poor among men will be joyful in the Holy One of Israel.+ 
20  For the tyrant will be no more,The boaster will come to his finish,And all those keeping alert to do harm will be destroyed,+
21  Those who with a false word make others guilty,Who lay traps for the defender* in the city gate,+And who with empty arguments deny justice to the righteous one.+ 
22  So this is what Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham,+ says to the house of Jacob: “Jacob will no longer be ashamed,And no more will his face grow pale.*+ 
23  For when he sees his children,Who are the work of my hands, in his midst,+They will sanctify my name;Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,And they will stand in awe of the God of Israel.+ 
24  Those who are wayward in spirit will acquire understanding,And those who complain will accept instruction.”
