10  “Ask Jehovah for rain in the time of the spring rain. It is Jehovah who makes the storm clouds,Who pours rain for them,+And gives vegetation in the field to everyone. 
 2  For the teraphim statues* have spoken deception;*And the diviners have visioned a lie. They speak about worthless dreams,And in vain they try to comfort. That is why they will wander like sheep. They will suffer, for there is no shepherd. 
 3  Against the shepherds my anger burns,And against the oppressive leaders* I will hold an accounting;For Jehovah of armies has turned his attention to his flock,+ to the house of Judah,And he has made them like his majestic horse in the battle. 
 4  From him comes the keyman,*From him comes the supporting ruler,*From him comes the battle bow;From him goes forth every overseer,* all of them together. 
 5  And they will become like warriors,Trampling down the mud of the streets in the battle. They will wage war, for Jehovah is with them;+And the riders of horses will be put to shame.+ 
 6  I will make the house of Judah superior,And the house of Joseph I will save.+ I will restore them,For I will show them mercy;+And they will be as though I had never cast them off;+For I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them. 
 7  Those of Eʹphra·im must become like a mighty warrior,And their heart will rejoice as though from wine.+ Their sons will see this and rejoice;Their heart will be joyful in Jehovah.+ 
 8  ‘I will whistle for them and gather them together;For I will redeem them,+ and they will become many,And continue to be many. 
 9  Though I scatter them like seed among the peoples,They will remember me in the distant places;With their sons they will revive and return. 
10  I will bring them back from the land of EgyptAnd gather them from As·syrʹi·a;+I will bring them to the land of Gilʹe·ad+ and Lebʹa·non,And there will be no more room for them.+ 
11  He must pass through the sea with distress;And in the sea he will strike down the waves;+All the depths of the Nile will dry up. The pride of As·syrʹi·a will be brought down,And the scepter of Egypt will depart.+ 
12  I will make them superior in Jehovah,+And they will walk about in his name,’+ declares Jehovah.”
