3  And he showed me Joshua+ the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan+ was standing at his right hand to resist him.
2  Then the angel of Jehovah said to Satan: “May Jehovah rebuke you, O Satan,+ yes, may Jehovah, who has chosen Jerusalem,+ rebuke you! Is not this one a burning log snatched out of the fire?” 
3  Now Joshua was clothed in filthy garments and standing before the angel.
4  The angel said to those standing before him, “Remove his filthy garments.” Then he said to him, “See, I have caused your error* to pass away from you, and you will be clothed with fine garments.”*+ 
5  So I said: “Let a clean turban be put on his head.”+ And they put the clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing nearby.
6  The angel of Jehovah then declared to Joshua:
7  “This is what Jehovah of armies says, ‘If you will walk in my ways and carry out your responsibilities before me, then you will serve as a judge in my house+ and take care of* my courtyards; and I will give you free access among these who are standing here.’ 
8  “‘Hear, please, O High Priest Joshua, you and your companions who sit before you, for these men serve as a sign; look! I am bringing in my servant+ Sprout!+
9  See the stone that I have set before Joshua! On the one stone are seven eyes; and I am engraving an inscription on it,’ declares Jehovah of armies, ‘and I will take away the guilt of that land in one day.’+ 
10  “‘In that day,’ declares Jehovah of armies, ‘Each of you will invite your neighbor to come under your vine and under your fig tree.’”+
