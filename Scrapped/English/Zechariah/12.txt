12  A pronouncement: “The word of Jehovah concerning Israel,” declares Jehovah,The One who stretched out the heavens,+Who laid the foundation of the earth,+And who formed the spirit* of man within him. 
2  “Here I am making Jerusalem a cup* that causes all the surrounding peoples to stagger; and there will be a siege against Judah as well as against Jerusalem.+
3  In that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy* stone to all the peoples. All those who lift it are sure to be severely injured;+ and all the nations of the earth will be gathered against her.+
4  In that day,” declares Jehovah, “I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness. I will keep my eyes on the house of Judah, but I will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.
5  And the sheikhs* of Judah will say in their heart, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are a strength to me by means of Jehovah of armies their God.’+
6  In that day I will make the sheikhs of Judah like a fiery pot among wood and like a fiery torch in a row of cut grain,+ and they will consume all the surrounding peoples on the right and on the left;+ and Jerusalem will again be inhabited in her place,* in Jerusalem.+ 
7  “And Jehovah will save the tents of Judah first, so that the beauty* of the house of David and the beauty* of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be too great over Judah.
8  In that day Jehovah will be a defense around the inhabitants of Jerusalem;+ in that day the one who stumbles* among them will be like David, and the house of David like God, like Jehovah’s angel who goes before them.+
9  And in that day I will be certain to annihilate all the nations that come against Jerusalem.+ 
10  “I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of favor and supplication, and they will look to the one whom they pierced,+ and they will wail over him as they would wail over an only son; and they will grieve bitterly over him as they would grieve over a firstborn son.
11  In that day the wailing in Jerusalem will be great, like the wailing at Ha·dad·rimʹmon in the Plain of Me·gidʹdo.+
12  And the land will wail, each family by itself; the family of David’s house by itself, and their women by themselves; the family of Nathan’s+ house by itself, and their women by themselves;
13  the family of Leʹvi’s+ house by itself, and their women by themselves; the family of the Shimʹe·ites+ by itself, and their women by themselves;
14  and all the families that are left remaining, each family by itself, and their women by themselves.
