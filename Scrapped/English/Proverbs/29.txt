29  A man who stiffens his neck* after much reproof+Will suddenly be broken beyond healing.+ 
 2  When the righteous are many, the people rejoice,But when the wicked one rules, the people groan.+ 
 3  A man who loves wisdom makes his father rejoice,+But the one who keeps company with prostitutes squanders his wealth.+ 
 4  By justice a king brings stability to a land,+But a man seeking bribes brings it to ruin. 
 5  A man who flatters his neighborSpreads out a net for his feet.+ 
 6  A bad man’s transgression ensnares him,+But the righteous one cries out joyfully and rejoices.+ 
 7  The righteous one is concerned about the legal rights of the poor,+But the wicked one has no such concern.+ 
 8  Boastful men inflame a town,+But those who are wise turn away anger.+ 
 9  When a wise man enters into a controversy with a fool,There will be ranting and ridicule, but no satisfaction.+ 
10  Bloodthirsty men hate anyone innocent,*+And they seek to take the life* of the upright.* 
11  A stupid person gives vent to all his feelings,*+But the wise one calmly keeps them in check.+ 
12  When a ruler pays attention to lies,All his servants will be wicked.+ 
13  The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:* Jehovah gives light to the eyes of both.* 
14  When a king judges the poor fairly,+His throne will always be secure.+ 
15  The rod* and reproof impart wisdom,+But a child left unrestrained brings shame on his mother. 
16  When the wicked increase, transgression increases,But the righteous will see their downfall.+ 
17  Discipline your son and he will bring you rest;And he will give you* great pleasure.+ 
18  Where there is no vision,* the people go unrestrained,+But happy are those who observe the law.+ 
19  A servant will not let himself be corrected by words,For though he understands, he does not obey.+ 
20  Have you seen a man hasty with his words?+ There is more hope for a fool than for him.+ 
21  If a servant is pampered from his youth,He will become thankless later on. 
22  A man prone to anger stirs up strife;+Anyone disposed to rage commits many transgressions.+ 
23  The haughtiness of a man will humble him,+But whoever is humble in spirit will obtain glory.+ 
24  The partner of a thief hates himself.* He may hear the call to testify,* but he reports nothing.+ 
25  Trembling at* men is* a snare,+But the one trusting in Jehovah will be protected.+ 
26  Many seek an audience with* a ruler,But it is from Jehovah that a man gets justice.+ 
27  An unjust man is detestable to the righteous,+But the one whose way is upright is detestable to the wicked one.+
