7  My son, keep my sayings,And treasure up my commandments.+ 
 2  Keep my commandments and live;+Guard my instruction* like the pupil of your eye. 
 3  Tie them around your fingers;Write them on the tablet of your heart.+ 
 4  Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” And call understanding “my relative,” 
 5  To guard you against the wayward* woman,+Against the immoral* woman and her smooth* words.+ 
 6  From the window of my house,Through my lattice, I looked down,
 7  And as I observed the naive* ones,I discerned among the youths a young man lacking good sense.*+ 
 8  He passed along the street near her corner,And he marched in the direction of her house
 9  In the twilight, in the evening,+At the approach of night and darkness. 
10  Then I saw a woman meet him,Dressed like* a prostitute,+ with a cunning heart. 
11  She is loud and defiant.+ She never stays* at home. 
12  One moment she is outside, next she is in the public squares,She lurks near every corner.+ 
13  She grabs hold of him and gives him a kiss;With a bold face, she says to him: 
14  “I had to offer communion sacrifices.+ Today I paid my vows. 
15  That is why I came out to meet you,To look for you, and I found you! 
16  I have spread fine covers upon my bed,Colorful linen from Egypt.+ 
17  I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.+ 
18  Come, let us drink our fill of love until the morning;Let us enjoy passionate love together,
19  For my husband is not at home;He has gone on a distant journey. 
20  He took a bag of money with him,And he will not return until the day of the full moon.” 
21  She misleads him with great persuasiveness.+ She seduces him with smooth speech. 
22  Suddenly he goes after her, like a bull to the slaughter,Like a fool to be punished in the stocks,*+
23  Until an arrow pierces his liver;Like a bird rushing into a trap, he does not know that it will cost him his life.*+ 
24  And now, my sons, listen to me;Pay attention to the words I speak. 
25  Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways. Do not stray onto her paths,+
26  For she has caused many to fall down slain,+And those she has killed are numerous.+ 
27  Her house leads to the Grave;*It goes down to the inner chambers of death.
