30  The weighty message contained in the words of Aʹgur son of Jaʹkeh, which he spoke to Ithʹi·el, to Ithʹi·el and Uʹcal. 
 2  I am more ignorant than anyone else,+And I lack the understanding a man should have. 
 3  I have not learned wisdom,And I do not possess the knowledge of the Most Holy One. 
 4  Who has ascended to heaven and then descended?+ Who has gathered the wind in the palms of both hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in his garment?+ Who has established* all the ends of the earth?+ What is his name and the name of his son—if you know? 
 5  Every saying of God is refined.+ He is a shield to those taking refuge in him.+ 
 6  Add nothing to his words,+Or he will reprove you,And you will be proved a liar. 
 7  Two things I ask of you. Do not withhold them from me before I die. 
 8  Remove untruth and lies far from me.+ Give me neither poverty nor riches. Just let me consume my portion of food,+
 9  So that I do not become satisfied and deny you and say, “Who is Jehovah?”+ Nor let me become poor and steal and dishonor* the name of my God. 
10  Do not slander a servant to his master,Or he may curse you and you will be found guilty.+ 
11  There is a generation that curses its fatherAnd does not bless its mother.+ 
12  There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes+But has not been cleansed from its filth.* 
13  There is a generation whose eyes are so haughtyAnd whose eyes look so arrogantly!+ 
14  There is a generation whose teeth are swordsAnd whose jaws are slaughtering knives;They devour the lowly ones of the earthAnd the poor from among mankind.+ 
15  The leeches have two daughters that cry, “Give! Give!” There are three things that do not get satisfied,Four that never say, “Enough!” 
16  —The Grave*+ and a barren womb,A land that is deprived of water,And fire that never says, “Enough!” 
17  The eye that mocks a father and despises obedience to a mother+—The ravens of the valley* will peck it out,And the young eagles will eat it up.+ 
18  There are three things that are beyond my comprehension,*And four that I do not understand: 
19  The way of an eagle in the heavens,The way of a serpent on a rock,The way of a ship in the open sea,And the way of a man with a young woman. 
20  This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats, she wipes her mouth;Then she says, “I have done nothing wrong.”+ 
21  There are three things that make the earth shudderAnd four things it cannot endure: 
22  When a slave rules as king,+When a fool is glutted with food,
23  When a hated* woman is taken as a wife,And when a servant girl takes the place of* her mistress.+ 
24  Four things on earth are among the smallest,But they are instinctively wise:*+ 
25  The ants are not strong creatures,*Yet they prepare their food in the summer.+ 
26  The rock badgers*+ are not mighty creatures,*Yet they make their house in the crags.+ 
27  The locusts+ have no king,Yet they all go forward in formation.*+ 
28  The gecko lizard+ clings with its feet,And it goes into the palace of a king. 
29  There are three things that have an impressive stride,Four that are impressive as they move: 
30  The lion, the mightiest among beasts,Which does not retreat from anyone;+
31  The greyhound; the male goat;And a king whose army is with him. 
32  If you have foolishly exalted yourself+Or if you have schemed to do so,Put your hand over your mouth.+ 
33  For as the churning of milk produces butterAnd the squeezing of the nose produces blood,So the stirring up of anger produces quarrels.+
