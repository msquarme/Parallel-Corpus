24  Do not envy evil men,And do not crave their company,+
 2  For their heart meditates on violence,And their lips speak of trouble. 
 3  By wisdom a house* is built up,+And by discernment it is made secure. 
 4  By knowledge its rooms are filledWith all sorts of precious and pleasant treasures.+ 
 5  A wise man is powerful,+And with knowledge a man increases his power. 
 6  By skillful direction* you will wage your war,+And through many advisers* there is victory.*+ 
 7  True wisdom is unattainable for a fool;+He has nothing to say in the city gate. 
 8  Anyone who plots evilWill be called a master schemer.+ 
 9  Foolish schemes* are sinful,And people detest a ridiculer.+ 
10  If you become discouraged in the day of distress,*Your strength will be meager. 
11  Rescue those who are being taken away to death,And hold back those staggering to the slaughter.+ 
12  If you say, “But we did not know about this,” Does not the One who examines hearts* discern it?+ Yes, the One who watches you* will knowAnd will repay each man according to his activity.+ 
13  My son, eat honey, because it is good;Honey from the comb is sweet to the taste. 
14  Likewise, know that wisdom is good for you.*+ If you find it, you will have a futureAnd your hope will not be cut off.+ 
15  Do not wickedly lie in ambush near the home of the righteous one;Do not destroy his place of rest. 
16  For the righteous one may fall seven times, and he will get up again,+But the wicked will be made to stumble by calamity.+ 
17  When your enemy falls, do not rejoice,And when he stumbles, do not let your heart be joyful;+
18  Otherwise, Jehovah will see and be displeased,And He will turn away his anger from him.*+ 
19  Do not be upset* because of evil men;Do not envy wicked people,
20  For there is no future for anyone evil;+The lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.+ 
21  My son, fear Jehovah and the king.+ And do not associate with dissenters,*+
22  For their disaster will arise suddenly.+ Who knows what ruin both* will bring upon them?+ 
23  These sayings also belong to the wise: Partiality in judgment is not good.+ 
24  Whoever says to the wicked one, “You are righteous,”+ Will be cursed by the peoples and denounced by the nations. 
25  But it will go well for those reproving him;+Blessings of good things will come upon them.+ 
26  People will kiss the lips of the one replying honestly.*+ 
27  Prepare your outside work, and get everything ready in the field;Then build your house.* 
28  Do not testify against your neighbor without grounds.+ Do not use your lips to deceive others.+ 
29  Do not say: “I will do to him just as he has done to me;I will repay him for what he did.”*+ 
30  I passed by the field of the lazy one,+By the vineyard of the man lacking good sense.* 
31  I saw that it was overgrown with weeds;The ground was covered with nettles,And its stone wall was broken down.+ 
32  I observed this and took it to heart;I saw it and learned this lesson:* 
33  A little sleep, a little slumbering,A little folding of the hands to rest,
34  And your poverty will come like a bandit,And your want like an armed man.+
