20  Wine is a ridiculer,+ alcohol is unruly;+Whoever goes astray by them is not wise.+ 
 2  The terror* of a king is like the growling of a lion;*+Whoever provokes his anger risks his own life.+ 
 3  It is honorable for a man to refrain from a dispute,+But every fool will become embroiled in it.+ 
 4  The lazy one does not plow in winter,So he will be begging during the harvest when he has nothing.*+ 
 5  The thoughts* of a man’s heart are like deep waters,But the discerning man draws them out. 
 6  Many men proclaim their loyal love,But who can find a faithful man? 
 7  The righteous one is walking in his integrity.+ Happy are his children* who come after him.+ 
 8  When the king sits on the throne to judge,+He sifts out all evil with his eyes.+ 
 9  Who can say: “I have cleansed my heart;+I am pure from my sin”?+ 
10  Dishonest weights and false measures*—Both are detestable to Jehovah.+ 
11  Even a child* is known by his actions,Whether his behavior is pure and right.+ 
12  The hearing ear and the seeing eye—Jehovah has made both of them.+ 
13  Do not love sleep, or you will come to poverty.+ Open your eyes, and you will be satisfied with bread.+ 
14  “It is no good, it is no good!” says the buyer;Then he goes away and boasts about himself.+ 
15  There is gold, also much coral,*But the lips of knowledge are something precious.+ 
16  Take a man’s garment if he has given security for a stranger;+Seize the pledge from him if he did so for a foreign woman.*+ 
17  Bread gained by deceit tastes good to a man,But afterward his mouth will be full of gravel.+ 
18  By consultation,* plans will succeed,*+And by skillful direction* wage your war.+ 
19  A slanderer goes about revealing confidential talk;+Do not associate with one who loves to gossip.* 
20  Whoever curses his father and his mother,His lamp will be extinguished when darkness comes.+ 
21  An inheritance obtained first by greedWill not be a blessing in the end.+ 
22  Do not say: “I will pay back evil!”+ Hope in Jehovah,+ and he will save you.+ 
23  Dishonest weights* are detestable to Jehovah,And deceptive scales are not good. 
24  A man’s footsteps are directed by Jehovah;+How can a man understand his own way?* 
25  It is a snare for a man to cry out rashly, “Holy!”+ And only later to give consideration to what he vowed.+ 
26  A wise king sifts out the wicked+And drives the threshing wheel over them.+ 
27  The breath of a man is the lamp of Jehovah,Searching through his innermost being. 
28  Loyal love and faithfulness safeguard the king;+By loyal love he sustains his throne.+ 
29  The glory of young men is their strength,+And the splendor of old men is their gray hair.+ 
30  Bruises and wounds purge* away evil,+And beatings cleanse one’s innermost being.
