14  The truly wise woman builds up her house,+But the foolish one tears it down with her own hands. 
 2  The one walking in his uprightness fears Jehovah,But the one whose ways are devious* despises Him. 
 3  The rod of haughtiness is in the mouth of the fool,But the lips of the wise will protect them. 
 4  Where there are no cattle the manger is clean,But the power of a bull yields an abundant harvest. 
 5  A faithful witness will not lie,But a false witness lies with every breath.+ 
 6  The scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none,But knowledge comes easily to the person with understanding.+ 
 7  Stay away from the foolish man,For you will not find knowledge on his lips.+ 
 8  By wisdom the shrewd man understands the way he is going,But the stupid are deceived* by their foolishness.+ 
 9  Fools make fun of guilt,*+But among the upright, there is a willingness to reconcile.* 
10  The heart knows its own bitterness,*And no outsider can share in its joy. 
11  The house of the wicked will be destroyed,+But the tent of the upright will flourish. 
12  There is a way that seems right to a man,+But in the end it leads to death.+ 
13  Even in laughter the heart may feel pain,And rejoicing may end in grief. 
14  The one wayward at heart will reap the results of his ways,+But the good man reaps the reward of his dealings.+ 
15  The naive* person believes every word,But the shrewd one ponders each step.+ 
16  The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil,But the stupid one is reckless* and overconfident. 
17  The one who is quick to anger acts foolishly,+But the man who thinks things out* is hated. 
18  The naive* will inherit foolishness,But the shrewd are crowned with knowledge.+ 
19  Bad people will have to bow down before the good,And the wicked will bow at the gates of the righteous. 
20  The poor man is hated even by his neighbors,+But many are the friends of the rich person.+ 
21  The one who despises his neighbor sins,But whoever shows compassion to the lowly is happy.+ 
22  Will not those who plot mischief go astray? But those intent on doing good will receive loyal love and faithfulness.+ 
23  There is benefit in every kind of hard work,But mere talk leads to want.+ 
24  The crown of the wise is their wealth;But the foolishness of the stupid is only foolishness.+ 
25  A true witness saves lives,*But a deceitful one lies with every breath. 
26  There is strong confidence in the fear of Jehovah,+And it will be a refuge for his children.+ 
27  The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life,To turn one away from the snares of death. 
28  A multitude of people are a king’s majesty,+But a ruler without subjects is ruined. 
29  The one who is slow to anger has great discernment,+But the impatient one displays his foolishness.+ 
30  A calm heart gives life* to the body,But jealousy is rottenness to the bones.+ 
31  The one who defrauds the lowly one insults his Maker,+But whoever shows compassion to the poor glorifies Him.+ 
32  The wicked one will be brought down by his own evil,But the righteous one will find refuge in his integrity.+ 
33  Wisdom rests quietly in the heart of an understanding person,+But among the stupid it must make itself known. 
34  Righteousness exalts a nation,+But sin is disgraceful to a people. 
35  The king finds pleasure in a servant who acts with insight,+But his fury is against the one who acts shamefully.+
