10  Proverbs of Solʹo·mon.+ A wise son makes his father rejoice,+But a foolish son is the grief of his mother. 
 2  The treasures gained by wickedness will be of no benefit,But righteousness is what rescues from death.+ 
 3  Jehovah will not cause the righteous one* to go hungry,+But he will deny the wicked what they crave. 
 4  Idle hands will cause poverty,+But diligent hands bring riches.+ 
 5  The son acting with insight gathers the crop in summer,But the son acting shamefully is fast asleep during the harvest.+ 
 6  Blessings are on the head of the righteous one,+But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 
 7  The memory* of the righteous one is due for a blessing,+But the name of the wicked will rot.+ 
 8  The wisehearted person will accept instructions,*+But the one speaking foolishly will be trodden down.+ 
 9  The one walking in integrity will walk in security,+But the one making his ways crooked will be found out.+ 
10  The one who slyly winks his eye causes grief,+And the one who speaks foolishly will be trodden down.+ 
11  The mouth of the righteous one is a source of life,+But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.+ 
12  Hatred is what stirs up contentions,But love covers over all transgressions.+ 
13  Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning person,+But the rod is for the back of one lacking good sense.*+ 
14  Those who are wise treasure up knowledge,+But the mouth of the fool invites ruin.+ 
15  The wealth* of a rich man is his fortified city. The ruin of the poor is their poverty.+ 
16  The activity of the righteous one leads to life;But the produce of the wicked one leads to sin.+ 
17  The one who heeds discipline is a path to life,*But the one who ignores reproof leads others astray. 
18  The one who conceals his hatred speaks lies,+And the one spreading malicious reports* is stupid. 
19  When words are many, transgression cannot be avoided,+But whoever controls his lips acts discreetly.+ 
20  The tongue of the righteous one is like the finest silver,+But the heart of the wicked one is worth little. 
21  The lips of the righteous one nourish* many,+But the foolish die for lack of sense.+ 
22  It is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich,+And He adds no pain* with it. 
23  Engaging in shameful conduct is like a game to the stupid one,But wisdom is for the man of discernment.+ 
24  What the wicked one fears will come upon him;But the desire of the righteous will be granted.+ 
25  When the storm passes by, the wicked one will be no more,+But the righteous one is a foundation forever.+ 
26  Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,So the lazy person is to the one who sends him.* 
27  The fear of Jehovah prolongs life,+But the years of the wicked will be cut short.+ 
28  The expectation* of the righteous brings joy,+But the hope of the wicked will perish.+ 
29  The way of Jehovah is a stronghold for the blameless one,+But it means ruin for evildoers.+ 
30  The righteous one will never be made to fall,+But the wicked will no longer inhabit the earth.+ 
31  The mouth of the righteous one produces* wisdom,But the perverse tongue will be cut off. 
32  The lips of the righteous one know what is pleasing,But the mouth of the wicked is perverse.
