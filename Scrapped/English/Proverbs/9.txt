9  True wisdom has built its house;It has carved* out its seven pillars. 
 2  It has fully prepared its meat;*It has mixed its wine;It has also arranged its table. 
 3  It has sent out its female servantsTo call out from the heights above the city:+ 
 4  “Whoever is inexperienced, let him come in here.” She says to the one lacking good sense:* 
 5  “Come, eat my breadAnd share in drinking the wine that I have mixed. 
 6  Leave behind your inexperience* and live;+Walk forward in the way of understanding.”+ 
 7  The one who corrects a ridiculer invites dishonor,+And whoever reproves someone wicked will get hurt. 
 8  Do not reprove a ridiculer, or he will hate you.+ Reprove a wise person, and he will love you.+ 
 9  Share with a wise person, and he will become wiser.+ Teach someone righteous, and he will add to his learning. 
10  The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom,+And knowledge of the Most Holy One+ is understanding. 
11  For by me your days will be many,+And years will be added to your life. 
12  If you become wise, you are wise to your own advantage,But if you are a ridiculer, you alone will bear it. 
13  A stupid woman is loud.+ She is ignorant and knows absolutely nothing. 
14  She sits at the entrance of her houseOn a seat in the high places of the city,+
15  Calling out to those passing by,To those walking straight ahead on their way: 
16  “Whoever is inexperienced, let him come in here.” She says to those lacking good sense:*+ 
17  “Stolen waters are sweet,And food eaten in secret is pleasant.”+ 
18  But he does not know that those powerless in death are there,That her guests are in the depths of the Grave.*+
