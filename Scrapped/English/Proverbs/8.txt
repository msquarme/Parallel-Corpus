8  Is not wisdom calling out? Is not discernment raising its voice?+ 
 2  On the heights+ along the road,It takes its position at the crossroads. 
 3  Next to the gates leading into the city,At the entrances of the doorways,It keeps crying out loudly:+ 
 4  “To you, O people, I am calling;I raise my voice to everyone.* 
 5  You inexperienced ones, learn shrewdness;+You stupid ones, acquire an understanding heart.* 
 6  Listen, for what I say is important,My lips speak what is right;
 7  For my mouth softly utters truth,And my lips detest what is wicked. 
 8  All the sayings of my mouth are righteous. None of them are twisted or crooked. 
 9  They are all straightforward to the discerningAnd right to those who have found knowledge. 
10  Take my discipline instead of silver,And knowledge rather than the finest gold,+
11  For wisdom is better than corals;*All other desirable things cannot compare to it. 
12  I, wisdom, dwell together with shrewdness;I have found knowledge and thinking ability.+ 
13  The fear of Jehovah means the hating of bad.+ I hate self-exaltation and pride+ and the evil way and perverse speech.+ 
14  I possess good advice and practical wisdom;+Understanding+ and power+ are mine. 
15  By me kings keep reigning,And high officials decree righteousness.+ 
16  By me princes keep ruling,And nobles judge in righteousness. 
17  I love those loving me,And those seeking me will find me.+ 
18  Riches and glory are with me,Lasting wealth* and righteousness. 
19  My fruitage is better than gold, even refined gold,And what I produce is better than the finest silver.+ 
20  I walk in the path of righteousness,In the middle of the pathways of justice;
21  I give a rich inheritance to those who love me,And I fill up their storehouses. 
22  Jehovah produced me as the beginning of his way,+The earliest of his achievements of long ago.+ 
23  From ancient times* I was installed,+From the start, from times earlier than the earth.+ 
24  When there were no deep waters,+ I was brought forth,*When there were no springs overflowing with water. 
25  Before the mountains were set in place,Before the hills, I was brought forth,
26  When he had not yet made the earth and its fieldsOr the first clods of earth’s soil. 
27  When he prepared the heavens,+ I was there;When he marked out the horizon* on the surface of the waters,+
28  When he established* the clouds above,When he founded the fountains of the deep,
29  When he set a decree for the seaThat its waters should not pass beyond his order,+When he established* the foundations of the earth,
30  Then I was beside him as a master worker.+ I was the one he was especially fond of+ day by day;I rejoiced before him all the time;+
31  I rejoiced over his habitable earth,And I was especially fond of the sons of men.* 
32  And now, my sons, listen to me;Yes, happy are those who keep my ways. 
33  Listen to discipline+ and become wise,And never neglect it. 
34  Happy is the man who listens to meBy coming early to* my doors day by day,By waiting next to my doorposts;
35  For the one finding me will find life,+And he receives approval from Jehovah. 
36  But the one who ignores me harms himself,*And those who hate me love death.”+
