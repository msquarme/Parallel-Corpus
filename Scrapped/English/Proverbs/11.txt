11  Dishonest* scales are detestable to Jehovah,But an accurate weight* brings pleasure to him.+ 
 2  When presumptuousness comes, dishonor will follow,+But wisdom is with the modest ones.+ 
 3  The integrity of the upright is what guides them,+But the deviousness of the treacherous will destroy them.+ 
 4  Wealth* will be of no benefit on the day of fury,+But righteousness is what will rescue from death.+ 
 5  The righteousness of the blameless one makes his path straight,But the wicked one will fall because of his own wickedness.+ 
 6  The righteousness of the upright will rescue them,+But the treacherous will be caught by their own desires.+ 
 7  When a wicked man dies, his hope perishes;And expectations based on his power also perish.+ 
 8  The righteous one is rescued from distress,And the wicked one takes his place.+ 
 9  By his mouth the apostate* brings his neighbor to ruin,But by knowledge the righteous are rescued.+ 
10  The goodness of the righteous makes a city rejoice,And when the wicked perish, there is a joyful cry.+ 
11  Because of the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,+But the mouth of the wicked tears it down.+ 
12  Whoever is lacking good sense* shows contempt for* his neighbor,But the man of true discernment remains silent.+ 
13  A slanderer goes about revealing confidential talk,+But the trustworthy person* keeps a confidence.* 
14  When there is no skillful direction,* the people fall,But there is success* through many advisers.*+ 
15  Whoever guarantees a loan* for a stranger is sure to fare badly,+But whoever avoids* shaking hands in a pledge will be secure. 
16  A gracious* woman acquires glory,+But ruthless men seize riches. 
17  A kind man* benefits himself,*+But the cruel person brings trouble* on himself.+ 
18  The wicked one earns deceptive wages,+But the one who sows righteousness receives a true reward.+ 
19  The one standing firmly for righteousness is in line for life,+But the one chasing after evil is in line for death. 
20  Those crooked at heart are detestable to Jehovah,+But those whose way is blameless bring pleasure to him.+ 
21  Be assured of this:* An evil person will not go unpunished,+But the children of the righteous will escape. 
22  Like a gold ring in the snout of a pigIs a beautiful woman who rejects good sense. 
23  The desire of the righteous leads to good,+But what the wicked hope for leads to fury. 
24  One gives generously* and ends up with more;+Another withholds what should be given, but he comes to poverty.+ 
25  The generous person* will prosper,*+And whoever refreshes* others will himself be refreshed.+ 
26  The people will curse the one who withholds grain,But they will bless the one who sells it. 
27  The one who diligently seeks to do good seeks favor,+But the one searching for bad—that is what will surely come upon him.+ 
28  The one trusting in his riches will fall,+But the righteous will flourish like the foliage.+ 
29  Anyone who brings trouble* on his household will inherit the wind,+And the fool will be a servant to the wisehearted one. 
30  The fruitage of the righteous one is a tree of life,+And the one who wins souls* is wise.+ 
31  If, indeed, the righteous one on earth is rewarded,How much more the wicked one and the sinner!+
