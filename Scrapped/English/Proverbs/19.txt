19  It is better to be poor and walk in integrity+Than to be stupid and speak lies.+ 
 2  A person* without knowledge is not good,+And the one who acts rashly* is sinning. 
 3  It is a man’s own foolishness that distorts his way,And his heart becomes enraged against Jehovah. 
 4  Wealth attracts many friends,But the poor man will be deserted even by his friend.+ 
 5  A false witness will not go unpunished,+And the one who lies with every breath will not escape.+ 
 6  Many seek the favor of a noble,*And everyone is a friend to the man who gives gifts. 
 7  All the brothers of a poor man hate him;+How much more he is shunned by his friends!+ He pursues them with requests, but no one responds. 
 8  Whoever acquires good sense* loves himself.*+ Whoever treasures discernment will find success.*+ 
 9  A false witness will not go unpunished,And the one who lies with every breath will perish.+ 
10  It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury;How much less for a servant to rule over princes!+ 
11  The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger,+And it is beauty on his part to overlook* an offense.*+ 
12  The king’s rage is like the growling of a lion,*+But his favor is like dew on the vegetation. 
13  A stupid son brings adversity on his father,+And a quarrelsome* wife is like a roof that never stops leaking.+ 
14  A house and wealth are inherited from fathers,But a discreet wife is from Jehovah.+ 
15  Laziness brings on a deep sleep,And a sluggish person* will go hungry.+ 
16  The one who keeps the commandment keeps his life;*+The one who is reckless about his ways will die.+ 
17  The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah,+And He will repay* him for what he does.+ 
18  Discipline your son while there is hope,+And do not become responsible for* his death.+ 
19  The hot-tempered man will pay the penalty;If you try to spare him, you will have to do it again and again.+ 
20  Listen to counsel and accept discipline,+In order to become wise in your future.+ 
21  Many are the plans in a man’s heart,But the counsel* of Jehovah is what will prevail.+ 
22  The desirable thing in a man is his loyal love;+And it is better to be poor than to be a liar. 
23  The fear of Jehovah leads to life;+The one who has it will have a pleasant rest, free from harm.+ 
24  The lazy one buries his hand in the banquet bowl,But he does not even bother to bring it back to his mouth.+ 
25  Strike the ridiculer,+ so that the inexperienced one may become shrewd,+And reprove the understanding one, so that he will increase in knowledge.+ 
26  The one who mistreats his father and drives away his motherIs a son causing shame and disgrace.+ 
27  My son, if you stop listening to discipline,You will stray from the sayings of knowledge. 
28  A worthless witness mocks justice,+And the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil.+ 
29  Judgment is in store for ridiculers,+And beatings for the back of the stupid ones.+
