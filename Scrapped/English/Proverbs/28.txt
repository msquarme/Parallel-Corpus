28  The wicked flee when no one pursues them,But the righteous are as confident as a lion.*+ 
 2  When there is transgression* in the land, it will have one prince after another,+But with the help of a man of discernment and knowledge, a prince* will long endure.+ 
 3  A poor man who defrauds the lowly+Is like a rain that sweeps away all the food. 
 4  Those who abandon the law praise the wicked one,But those who observe the law are indignant with them.+ 
 5  Evil men cannot understand justice,But those who seek Jehovah can understand everything.+ 
 6  Better is a poor man who walks in his integrityThan a rich man whose ways are corrupt.+ 
 7  An understanding son observes the law,But a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.+ 
 8  The one who increases his wealth by interest+ and usuryAmasses it for the one who shows favor to the poor.+ 
 9  The one refusing to listen to the law—Even his prayer is detestable.+ 
10  The one misleading the upright into an evil course will fall into his own pit,+But the blameless will inherit what is good.+ 
11  A rich man is wise in his own eyes,+But a poor man with discernment can see through him.+ 
12  When the righteous triumph, there is great glory,But when the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding.+ 
13  The one covering over his transgressions will not succeed,+But whoever confesses and abandons them will be shown mercy.+ 
14  Happy is the man who is always on guard,*But whoever hardens his heart will fall into calamity.+ 
15  Like a growling lion and a charging bearIs a wicked ruler over a helpless people.+ 
16  A leader without discernment abuses his power,+But the one hating dishonest profit will prolong his life.+ 
17  A man burdened with bloodguilt for taking someone’s life* will keep fleeing until the grave.*+ Let no one support him. 
18  The one walking faultlessly will be saved,+But the one whose ways are crooked will suddenly fall.+ 
19  The one cultivating his ground will have plenty of bread,But the one taking up worthless pursuits will have his fill of poverty.+ 
20  A faithful man will receive many blessings,+But the one hastening to get rich will not remain innocent.+ 
21  It is not good to show partiality;+But a man might do wrong for a piece of bread. 
22  An envious* man is eager for wealth,Not knowing that poverty will overtake him. 
23  Whoever reproves a man+ will afterward find more favor+Than someone who flatters with his tongue. 
24  Whoever robs his father and mother and says, “It is not wrong,”+ Is a partner of the man who causes ruin.+ 
25  The greedy person* stirs up dissension,But whoever relies on Jehovah will prosper.*+ 
26  Whoever trusts in his own heart is stupid,+But the one who walks in wisdom will escape.+ 
27  Whoever gives to the poor will lack nothing,+But the one who closes his eyes to them will receive many curses. 
28  When the wicked rise to power, a man hides himself,But when they perish, the righteous increase.+
