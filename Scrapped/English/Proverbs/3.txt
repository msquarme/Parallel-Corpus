3  My son, do not forget my teaching,*And may your heart observe my commandments,
 2  Because they will add many daysAnd years of life and peace to you.+ 
 3  Do not let loyal love and faithfulness* leave you.+ Tie them around your neck;Write them on the tablet of your heart;+
 4  Then you will find favor and good insightIn the eyes of God and man.+ 
 5  Trust in Jehovah+ with all your heart,And do not rely* on your own understanding.+ 
 6  In all your ways take notice of him,+And he will make your paths straight.+ 
 7  Do not become wise in your own eyes.+ Fear Jehovah and turn away from bad. 
 8  It will be a healing to your body*And refreshment for your bones. 
 9  Honor Jehovah with your valuable things,+With the firstfruits* of all your produce;*+
10  Then your storehouses will be completely filled,+And your vats* will overflow with new wine. 
11  My son, do not reject the discipline of Jehovah,+And do not loathe his reproof,+
12  For those whom Jehovah loves he reproves,+Just as a father does a son in whom he delights.+ 
13  Happy is the man who finds wisdom+And the man who acquires discernment;
14  To gain it is better than gaining silver,And having it as profit is better than having gold.+ 
15  It is more precious than corals;*Nothing you desire can compare to it. 
16  Long life is in its right hand;Riches and glory are in its left hand. 
17  Its ways are pleasant,And all its paths are peaceful.+ 
18  It is a tree of life to those who take hold of it,And those who keep firm hold of it will be called happy.+ 
19  Jehovah founded the earth in wisdom.+ He solidly established the heavens in discernment.+ 
20  By his knowledge the watery deeps were split apartAnd the cloudy skies dripped with dew.+ 
21  My son, do not lose sight of them.* Safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability;
22  They will give you* lifeAnd be an adornment for your neck;
23  Then you will walk on your way in safety,And your foot will never stumble.*+ 
24  When you lie down, you will have no fear;+You will lie down, and your sleep will be pleasant.+ 
25  You will not fear any sudden terror+Nor the storm that is coming on the wicked.+ 
26  For Jehovah will prove to be your source of confidence;+He will keep your foot from being caught.+ 
27  Do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it*+If it is within your power* to help.+ 
28  Do not say to your neighbor, “Go away; come back later! I will give it to you tomorrow,” If you can give it now. 
29  Do not plot harm against your neighbor+When he lives in a sense of security with you. 
30  Do not quarrel with a man for no reason+If he has done nothing bad to you.+ 
31  Do not envy the violent man+Nor choose any of his ways,
32  For Jehovah detests a devious person,+But His close friendship is with the upright.+ 
33  The curse of Jehovah is on the house of the wicked one,+But he blesses the home of the righteous.+ 
34  For he mocks those who ridicule,+But he shows favor to the meek.+ 
35  The wise will inherit honor,But the stupid ones glorify dishonor.+
