15  A mild* answer turns away rage,+But a harsh* word stirs up anger.+ 
 2  The tongue of the wise makes good use of knowledge,+But the mouth of the stupid blurts out foolishness. 
 3  The eyes of Jehovah are everywhere,Watching both the bad and the good.+ 
 4  A calm tongue* is a tree of life,+But twisted speech causes despair.* 
 5  A fool disrespects his father’s discipline,+But a shrewd person accepts correction.*+ 
 6  In the house of the righteous one there is abundant treasure,But the produce* of the wicked one brings him trouble.+ 
 7  The lips of the wise spread knowledge,+But not so the heart of the stupid one.+ 
 8  The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable to Jehovah,+But the prayer of the upright is a pleasure to Him.+ 
 9  Jehovah detests the way of the wicked one,+But he loves the one who pursues righteousness.+ 
10  Discipline seems bad* to one forsaking the way,+But whoever hates reproof will die.+ 
11  The Grave* and the place of destruction* are in full view of Jehovah.+ How much more so the hearts of men!+ 
12  The scoffer does not love the one correcting* him.+ He will not consult the wise.+ 
13  A joyful heart makes for a cheerful countenance,But heartache crushes the spirit.+ 
14  The understanding heart seeks knowledge,+But the mouth of the stupid feeds on* foolishness.+ 
15  All the days of the afflicted one are bad,+But the one with a cheerful* heart has a continual feast.+ 
16  Better is a little in the fear of Jehovah+Than great wealth along with anxiety.*+ 
17  Better is a dish of vegetables where there is love+Than a fattened* bull where there is hatred.+ 
18  A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,+But one who is slow to anger calms a quarrel.+ 
19  The way of the lazy one is like a hedge of thorns,+But the path of the upright is like a level highway.+ 
20  A wise son makes his father rejoice,+But a stupid man despises his mother.+ 
21  Foolishness is a joy to one lacking good sense,*+But the man of discernment walks straight ahead.+ 
22  Plans fail when there is no consultation,*But there is accomplishment through many advisers.*+ 
23  A man rejoices in giving the right answer,*+And a word spoken at the right time—how good it is!+ 
24  The path of life leads upward to one with insight,+To turn him away from the Grave* below.+ 
25  Jehovah will tear down the house of the haughty,+But he will preserve the boundary of the widow.+ 
26  Jehovah detests the schemes of the wicked one,+But pleasant sayings are pure to Him.+ 
27  The one making dishonest profit brings trouble* on his own household,+But the one hating bribes will keep living.+ 
28  The heart of the righteous one meditates before answering,*+But the mouth of the wicked blurts out bad things. 
29  Jehovah is far away from the wicked,But he hears the prayer of the righteous.+ 
30  Bright eyes make* the heart rejoice;A good report invigorates the bones.*+ 
31  The one who listens to life-giving reproofIs at home among the wise.+ 
32  Anyone refusing discipline despises his life,*+But whoever listens to reproof acquires understanding.*+ 
33  The fear of Jehovah is a training in wisdom,+And before glory there is humility.+
