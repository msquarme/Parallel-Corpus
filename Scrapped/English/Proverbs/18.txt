18  Whoever isolates himself pursues his own selfish desires;He rejects* all practical wisdom. 
 2  A stupid person takes no pleasure in understanding;He would rather disclose what is in his heart.+ 
 3  When a wicked person comes, contempt also comes,And along with dishonor there is disgrace.+ 
 4  The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters.+ The fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook. 
 5  It is not good to show partiality to the wicked one+Or to deprive the righteous one of justice.+ 
 6  The speech of the stupid one leads to quarrels,+And his mouth invites a beating.+ 
 7  The mouth of the stupid is his ruin,+And his lips are a snare for his life.* 
 8  The words of a slanderer are like tasty morsels;*+They are gulped right down into the stomach.+ 
 9  Whoever is lazy in his workIs a brother to the one who causes ruin.+ 
10  The name of Jehovah is a strong tower.+ Into it the righteous one runs and receives protection.*+ 
11  The wealth of the rich is his fortified city;It is like a protective wall in his imagination.+ 
12  Before a crash a man’s heart is lofty,+And before glory there is humility.+ 
13  When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts,It is foolish and humiliating.+ 
14  A person’s spirit can sustain him through illness,+But who can bear a crushed spirit?*+ 
15  The heart of the understanding one acquires knowledge,+And the ear of the wise seeks to find knowledge. 
16  A man’s gift opens the way for him;+It gives him access to great people. 
17  The first to state his case seems right,+Until the other party comes and cross-examines him.*+ 
18  Casting lots puts an end to disputes+And decides between* strong opponents. 
19  A brother offended is more unyielding than a fortified city,+And there are disputes like the bars of a fortress.+ 
20  From the fruitage of a man’s speech* his stomach will be filled;+He will be satisfied with what his lips produce. 
21  Death and life are in the power of the tongue;+Those who love to use it will eat its fruitage.+ 
22  The one who finds a good wife has found something good,+And he receives Jehovah’s favor.*+ 
23  The poor man implores when speaking,But the rich man answers harshly. 
24  There are companions ready to crush one another,+But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.+
