13  A wise son accepts his father’s discipline,+But the scoffer does not listen to a rebuke.*+ 
 2  From the fruitage of his speech* a man will eat what is good,+But the very desire* of the treacherous is for violence. 
 3  The one guarding his mouth* protects his life,*+But the one opening his lips wide will come to ruin.+ 
 4  The lazy person has his cravings, yet he* has nothing,+But the diligent one* will be fully satisfied.*+ 
 5  The righteous one hates lies,+But the actions of the wicked bring shame and disgrace. 
 6  Righteousness protects the one whose way is innocent,+But wickedness brings down the sinner. 
 7  There is one who pretends to be rich, yet has nothing;+There is another who pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth. 
 8  Riches are the ransom for a man’s life,*+But the poor are not even threatened.*+ 
 9  The light of the righteous shines brightly,*+But the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.+ 
10  Presumptuousness leads only to strife,+But wisdom belongs to those who seek advice.*+ 
11  Wealth quickly gained* will dwindle,+But the wealth of the one who gathers it little by little* will increase. 
12  Expectation* postponed makes the heart sick,+But a desire realized is a tree of life.+ 
13  Whoever despises instruction* will pay the penalty,+But the one who respects the commandment will be rewarded.+ 
14  The teaching* of the wise one is a source of life+To turn one away from the snares of death. 
15  Keen insight wins favor,But the way of the treacherous is harsh. 
16  The shrewd person acts with knowledge,+But the fool exposes his own foolishness.+ 
17  A wicked messenger falls into trouble,+But a faithful envoy brings healing.+ 
18  Whoever neglects discipline comes to poverty and disgrace,But the one accepting correction* will be glorified.+ 
19  Desire when realized is sweet to a person,*+But the stupid hate to turn away from bad.+ 
20  The one walking with the wise will become wise,+But the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.+ 
21  Calamity pursues sinners,+But prosperity rewards the righteous.+ 
22  The good person leaves an inheritance to his grandchildren,But the sinner’s wealth will be stored up for the righteous one.+ 
23  The plowed field of the poor yields much food,But it* may be swept away by injustice. 
24  Whoever holds back his rod* hates his son,+But the one who loves him disciplines him diligently.*+ 
25  The righteous one eats and satisfies his appetite,*+But the stomach of the wicked is empty.+
