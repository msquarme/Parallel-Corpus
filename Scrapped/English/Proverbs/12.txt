12  The one who loves discipline loves knowledge,+But the one who hates reproof is unreasoning.*+ 
 2  The good person obtains Jehovah’s approval,But He condemns the man of wicked schemes.+ 
 3  No man is made secure by wickedness,+But the righteous will never be uprooted. 
 4  A capable wife is a crown to her husband,+But the wife who acts shamefully is like rottenness in his bones.+ 
 5  The thoughts of the righteous are just,But the guidance of the wicked is deceptive. 
 6  The words of the wicked are a deadly ambush,*+But the mouth of the upright saves them.+ 
 7  When the wicked are overthrown, they are no more,But the house of the righteous will keep standing.+ 
 8  A man is praised for the discretion of his mouth,+But one with a twisted heart will be treated with contempt.+ 
 9  Better to be lightly esteemed and have a servantThan to glorify oneself and have no food.*+ 
10  The righteous one takes care of his domestic animals,*+But even the mercy of the wicked is cruel. 
11  The one who cultivates his land will be satisfied with food,+But the one pursuing worthless things is lacking good sense.* 
12  The wicked man envies what other evil men have caught,But the root of the righteous bears fruit. 
13  The evil man is ensnared by his own sinful speech,+But the righteous one escapes from distress. 
14  From the fruitage of his speech* a man is satisfied with good,+And the work of his hands will reward him. 
15  The way of the fool is right in his own eyes,+But the wise one accepts advice.*+ 
16  A fool immediately* shows his annoyance,+But the shrewd man overlooks* an insult. 
17  The one who testifies faithfully will tell the truth,*But a false witness speaks deceit. 
18  Thoughtless speech is like the stabs of a sword,But the tongue of the wise is a healing.+ 
19  Truthful lips will endure forever,+But a lying tongue will last for only a moment.+ 
20  Deceit is in the heart of those who plot mischief,But those who promote* peace have joy.+ 
21  No harm will befall the righteous one,+But the wicked will have their fill of calamity.+ 
22  Lying lips are detestable to Jehovah,+But those acting faithfully bring pleasure to him. 
23  A shrewd man conceals what he knows,But the heart of the fool blurts out his foolishness.+ 
24  The hand of the diligent ones will rule,+But idle hands will be put to forced labor.+ 
25  Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,*+But a good word cheers it up.+ 
26  The righteous one searches out his pastures,But the course of the wicked leads them astray. 
27  The lazy do not chase after the prey,+But diligence is a man’s precious treasure. 
28  The path of righteousness leads to life;+Along its pathway there is no death.
