4  Then he made the copper altar,+ 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 10 cubits high. 
2  He made the Sea*+ of cast metal. It was circular in shape, 10 cubits from brim to brim and 5 cubits high, and it took a measuring line 30 cubits long to encircle it.+
3  And there were ornamental gourds+ under it, completely encircling it, ten to a cubit all around the Sea. The gourds were in two rows and were cast in one piece with it.
4  It stood on 12 bulls,+ 3 facing north, 3 facing west, 3 facing south, and 3 facing east; and the Sea rested on them, and all their hindquarters were toward the center.
5  And its thickness was a handbreadth;* and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. The reservoir could hold* 3,000 bath measures.* 
6  Further, he made ten basins for washing and put five to the right and five to the left.+ They would rinse in them the things used for the burnt offering.+ But the Sea was for the priests for washing.+ 
7  He then made ten lampstands of gold,+ as specified,+ and put them in the temple, five on the right and five on the left.+ 
8  He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right and five on the left;+ and he made 100 golden bowls. 
9  Then he made the courtyard+ of the priests+ and the great court*+ and the doors for the court, and he overlaid their doors with copper.
10  And he placed the Sea on the right side, toward the southeast.+ 
11  Hiʹram also made the cans, the shovels, and the bowls.+ So Hiʹram finished the work that he did for King Solʹo·mon on the house of the true God:+
12  the two pillars+ and the bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks+ to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the pillars;
13  the 400 pomegranates+ for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on the pillars;+
14  the ten carriages* and the ten basins on the carriages;+
15  the Sea and the 12 bulls beneath it;+
16  and the cans, the shovels, the forks,+ and all their utensils Hiʹram-aʹbiv+ made of polished copper for King Solʹo·mon for the house of Jehovah.
17  The king cast them in the district of the Jordan in the thick clay between Sucʹcoth+ and Zerʹe·dah.
18  Solʹo·mon made all these utensils in great quantities; the weight of the copper was not ascertained.+ 
19  Solʹo·mon made all the utensils+ for the house of the true God: the altar of gold;+ the tables+ with the showbread on them;+
20  the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold,+ to burn before the innermost room according to the requirements;
21  and the blossoms, the lamps, and the snuffers,* of gold, the purest gold;
22  the extinguishers, the bowls, the cups, and the fire holders, of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, its inner doors for the Most Holy,+ and the doors of the house of the temple, of gold.+
