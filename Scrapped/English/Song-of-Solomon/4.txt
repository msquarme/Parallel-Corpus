4  “Look! You are beautiful, my beloved. Look! You are beautiful. Your eyes are those of doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goatsStreaming down the mountains of Gilʹe·ad.+ 
 2  Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn sheepThat have come up from being washed,All of them bearing twins,And not one has lost her young. 
 3  Your lips are like a scarlet thread,And your speech is delightful. Like a segment of pomegranateAre your cheeks* behind your veil. 
 4  Your neck+ is like the tower of David,+Built with courses of stoneUpon which are hung a thousand shields,All the circular shields of the mighty men.+ 
 5  Your two breasts are like two fawns,The twins of a gazelle,+That feed among the lilies.” 
 6  “Until the day grows breezy* and the shadows flee,I will go my way to the mountain of myrrhAnd to the hill of frankincense.”+ 
 7  “You are altogether beautiful, my beloved,+There is no blemish in you. 
 8  Come with me from Lebʹa·non, my bride,Come with me from Lebʹa·non.+ Descend from the peak of A·maʹnah,*From the peak of Seʹnir, the peak of Herʹmon,+From the lairs of lions, from the mountains of leopards. 
 9  You have captured my heart,+ my sister, my bride,You have captured my heart with one glance of your eyes,With one pendant of your necklace. 
10  How beautiful your expressions of affection are,+ my sister, my bride! Your expressions of affection are far better than wine,+And the fragrance of your perfume than any spice!+ 
11  Your lips, my bride, drip with comb honey.+ Honey and milk are under your tongue,+And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebʹa·non. 
12  My sister, my bride, is like a locked garden,A locked garden, a spring sealed shut. 
13  Your shoots* are a paradise* of pomegranatesWith the choicest fruits, with henna along with spikenard plants,
14  Spikenard+ and saffron, cane*+ and cinnamon,+With all sorts of trees of frankincense, myrrh, and aloes,+Along with all the finest perfumes.+ 
15  You are a garden spring, a well of fresh water,And flowing streams from Lebʹa·non.+ 
16  Awake, O north wind;Come in, O south wind. Breathe* upon my garden. Let its fragrance spread.” “Let my dear one come into his gardenAnd eat its choicest fruits.”
