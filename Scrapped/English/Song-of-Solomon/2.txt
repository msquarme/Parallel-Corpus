2  “I am but a saffron* of the coastal plain,A lily of the valleys.”+ 
 2  “Like a lily among thornsIs my beloved among the daughters.” 
 3  “Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest,So is my dear one among the sons. I passionately desire to sit in his shade,And his fruit is sweet to my taste. 
 4  He brought me into the banquet house,*And his banner over me was love. 
 5  Refresh me with raisin cakes;+Sustain me with apples,For I am lovesick. 
 6  His left hand is under my head,And his right hand embraces me.+ 
 7  I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,By the gazelles+ and the does of the field: Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined.+ 
 8  The sound of my dear one! Look! Here he comes,Climbing the mountains, leaping over the hills. 
 9  My dear one is like a gazelle, like a young stag.+ There he is, standing behind our wall,Gazing through the windows,Looking through the lattices. 
10  My dear one speaks, he says to me: ‘Rise up, my beloved,My beautiful one, come away with me. 
11  Look! The winter* has passed. The rains are over and gone. 
12  Blossoms have appeared in the land,+The time of pruning has arrived,+And the song of the turtledove is heard in our land.+ 
13  The fig tree ripens its early figs;+The vines are in blossom and give off their fragrance. Rise up, my beloved, and come. My beautiful one, come away with me. 
14  O my dove, in the retreats of the crag,+In the recesses of the cliff,Let me see you and hear your voice,+For your voice is pleasant and your appearance is lovely.’”+ 
15  “Catch the foxes for us,The little foxes that ruin the vineyards,For our vineyards are in bloom.” 
16  “My dear one is mine and I am his.+ He is shepherding+ among the lilies.+ 
17  Until the day grows breezy* and the shadows flee,Return quickly, O my dear one,Like the gazelle+ or the young stag+ upon the mountains of separation.*
