6  “Where has your dear one gone,O most beautiful of women? Which way did your dear one turn? Let us seek him with you.” 
 2  “My dear one has gone down to his garden,To the beds of spice plants,To shepherd among the gardensAnd to pick lilies.+ 
 3  I am my dear one’s,And my dear one is mine.+ He is shepherding among the lilies.”+ 
 4  “You are as beautiful as Tirʹzah,*+ my beloved,+As lovely as Jerusalem,+As breathtaking as armies around their banners.+ 
 5  Turn your eyes+ away from me,For they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of goatsStreaming down the slopes of Gilʹe·ad.+ 
 6  Your teeth are like a flock of sheepThat have come up from being washed,All of them bearing twins,And not one has lost her young. 
 7  Like a segment of pomegranateAre your cheeks* behind your veil. 
 8  There may be 60 queensAnd 80 concubinesAnd young women without number.+ 
 9  But only one is my dove,+ my flawless one. The only one of her mother. She is the favorite* of the one who bore her. The daughters see her, and they pronounce her happy;Queens and concubines, and they praise her. 
10  ‘Who is she who shines* like the dawn,As beautiful as the full moon,As pure as the sunlight,As breathtaking as armies around their banners?’”+ 
11  “I went down to the garden of nut trees+To see the new growth in the valley,*To see whether the vine had sprouted,*Whether the pomegranate trees had blossomed. 
12  Before I knew it,My desire* had put meAt the chariots of my noble* people.” 
13  “Return, return, O Shuʹlam·mite! Return, return,That we may look upon you!” “Why do you gaze upon the Shuʹlam·mite?”+ “She is like the dance of two companies!”*
