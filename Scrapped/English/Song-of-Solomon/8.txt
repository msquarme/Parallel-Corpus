8  “If only you were like my brother,Who nursed at my mother’s breasts! Then if I found you outside, I would kiss you,+And no one would despise me. 
 2  I would lead you;I would bring you into the house of my mother,+She who taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink,The fresh juice of pomegranates. 
 3  His left hand would be under my head,And his right hand would embrace me.+ 
 4  I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem: Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined.”+ 
 5  “Who is this coming up from the wilderness,Leaning upon her dear one?” “Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was in labor with you. There she who gave birth to you was in labor. 
 6  Place me as a seal upon your heart,As a seal upon your arm,For love is as strong as death is,+And exclusive devotion is as unyielding as the Grave.* Its flames are a blazing fire, the flame of Jah.*+

 8  “We have a little sister,+And she has no breasts. What will we do for our sisterOn the day when she is spoken for?” 
 9  “If she is a wall,We will build upon her a battlement of silver,But if she is a door,We will board her up with a cedar plank.” 
10  “I am a wall,And my breasts are like towers. So in his eyes I have becomeAs one who finds peace. 
11  Solʹo·mon had a vineyard+ in Baʹal-haʹmon. He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers. Each one would bring in a thousand pieces of silver for its fruit. 
12  I have my own vineyard at my disposal. The thousand pieces of silver* belong to you, O Solʹo·mon,And two hundred to those who care for its fruit.” 
13  “O you who are dwelling in the gardens,+The companions listen for your voice. Let me hear it.”+ 
14  “Hurry, my dear one,And be swift like a gazelle+Or a young stagUpon the mountains of spices.”
