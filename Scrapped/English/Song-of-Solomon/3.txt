3  “Upon my bed during the nights,I sought the one I love.*+ I sought him, but I did not find him.+ 
 2  I will arise and roam the city;In the streets and in the public squares,Let me seek the one I love.* I sought him, but I did not find him. 
 3  The watchmen making their rounds in the city found me.+ ‘Have you seen the one I love?’* 
 4  Scarcely had I passed by themWhen I found the one I love.* I held on to him, I would not let him goUntil I brought him into my mother’s house,+Into the interior room of her who conceived me. 
 5  I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,By the gazelles and the does of the field: Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined.”+ 
 6  “What is this coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke,Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,With all the fragrant powders of a merchant?”+ 
 7  “Look! It is the couch belonging to Solʹo·mon. Sixty mighty men surround it,Of the mighty men of Israel,+
 8  All of them armed with a sword,All trained in warfare,Each with his sword at his sideTo guard against the terrors of the night.” 
 9  “It is the royal litter* of King Solʹo·monThat he made for himself from the trees of Lebʹa·non.+ 
10  Its pillars he made of silver,Its supports of gold. Its seat is of purple wool;Its interior was lovingly decoratedBy the daughters of Jerusalem.” 
11  “Go out, O daughters of Zion,Gaze at King Solʹo·monWearing the wedding crown* his mother+ made for himOn the day of his marriage,On the day of his heart’s rejoicing.”
