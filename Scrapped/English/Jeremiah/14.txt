14  This is the word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah concerning the droughts:+ 
 2  Judah mourns,+ and its gates have faded away. They sink to the ground dejected,And a cry goes up from Jerusalem. 
 3  And their masters send their servants* for water. They go to the water holes* and find no water. They return with their vessels empty. They are ashamed and disappointed,And they cover their heads. 
 4  Because the ground is cracked,For there is no rain on the land,+The farmers are dismayed and cover their heads. 
 5  Even the doe in the field forsakes her newbornBecause there is no grass. 
 6  The wild donkeys stand on the bare hills. They pant for air like jackals;Their eyes fail because there is no vegetation.+ 
 7  Although our own errors testify against us,O Jehovah, act for the sake of your name.+ For our acts of unfaithfulness are many,+And it is against you that we have sinned. 
 8  O hope of Israel, his Savior+ in times of distress,Why are you like a stranger in the land,Like a traveler who stops only to spend the night? 
 9  Why are you like a man who is stunned,Like a mighty man who cannot save? For you are among us, O Jehovah,+And your name has been called on us.+ Do not abandon us. 
10  This is what Jehovah says concerning this people: “They love to wander about;+ they have not restrained their feet.+ So Jehovah finds no pleasure in them.+ Now he will remember their error and call them to account for their sins.”+ 
11  Then Jehovah said to me: “Do not pray for good to come to this people.+
12  When they fast, I do not listen to their entreaties,+ and when they offer whole burnt offerings and grain offerings, I take no pleasure in them,+ for by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence,* I will do away with them.”+ 
13  At this I said: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Here the prophets are saying to them, ‘You will not see the sword, and famine will not come upon you, but I will give you true peace in this place.’”+ 
14  Jehovah then said to me: “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name.+ I have not sent them or commanded them or spoken to them.+ A lying vision and a worthless divination and the deceit of their own heart is what they are prophesying to you.+
15  Therefore this is what Jehovah says concerning the prophets who are prophesying in my name, though I did not send them, and who say that no sword or famine will occur in this land: ‘By sword and by famine those prophets will perish.+
16  And the people to whom they are prophesying will be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword, with no one to bury them+—them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters—for I will pour out on them the calamity they deserve.’+ 
17  “You must speak this word to them,‘Let my eyes stream with tears night and day, let them not cease,+For the virgin daughter of my people has been completely crushed and broken,+With an extremely severe wound. 
18  If I go out into the field and look,I see those slain by the sword!+ And if I come into the city,I see the diseases from the famine!+ For both the prophet and the priest have gone around in a land that they do not know.’”+ 
19  Have you completely rejected Judah, or have you* abhorred Zion?+ Why have you struck us, so that there is no healing for us?+ There was a hope for peace, but nothing good came,For a time of healing, but there is terror!+ 
20  We acknowledge our wickedness, O Jehovah,And the error of our forefathers,For we have sinned against you.+ 
21  For the sake of your name, do not reject us;+Do not despise your glorious throne. Remember, and do not break your covenant with us.+ 
22  Can any of the worthless idols of the nations give rain,Or can even the heavens send showers of rain on their own? Are you not the only One, O Jehovah our God?+ And we hope in you,For you alone have done all these things.
