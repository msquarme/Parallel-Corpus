6  Take shelter, O sons of Benjamin, away from Jerusalem. Blow the horn+ in Te·koʹa;+Light a fire signal over Beth-hac·cheʹrem! For a calamity looms from the north, a great disaster.+ 
 2  The daughter of Zion resembles a beautiful and delicate woman.+ 
 3  The shepherds and their droves will come. They will pitch their tents all around her,+Each grazing the flock in his care.+ 
 4  “Prepare for* war against her! Rise up, and let us attack her at midday!” “Woe to us, for the day is declining,For the shadows of evening are getting longer!” 
 5  “Rise up, and let us attack during the nightAnd destroy her fortified towers.”+ 
 6  For this is what Jehovah of armies says: “Cut down wood and raise up a siege rampart against Jerusalem.+ She is the city that must be held to account;There is nothing but oppression within her.+ 
 7  As a cistern keeps its water cool,*So she keeps her wickedness cool.* Violence and destruction are heard in her;+Sickness and plague are constantly before me. 
 8  Be warned, O Jerusalem, or I* will turn away from you in disgust;+I will make you desolate, a land without inhabitants.”+ 
 9  This is what Jehovah of armies says: “They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as the last grapes on a vine. Pass your hand again like one gathering grapes from the vines.” 
10  “To whom should I speak and give warning? Who will listen? Look! Their ears are closed,* so that they are unable to pay attention.+ Look! The word of Jehovah has become something they scorn;+They find no pleasure in it. 
11  So I am filled with the wrath of Jehovah,And I am tired of holding it in.”+ “Pour it out on the child in the street,+On the groups of young men gathered together. They will all be captured, a man along with his wife,The old men along with the very old.*+ 
12  Their houses will be turned over to others,Together with their fields and their wives.+ For I will stretch my hand out against the inhabitants of the land,” declares Jehovah. 
13  “For from the least to the greatest, each one is making dishonest gain;+From the prophet to the priest, each one is practicing fraud.+ 
14  And they try to heal the breakdown* of my people lightly,* saying,‘There is peace! There is peace!’ When there is no peace.+ 
15  Do they feel ashamed of the detestable things they have done? They feel no shame at all! They do not even know how to feel humiliated!+ So they will fall among the fallen. When I bring punishment on them they will stumble,” says Jehovah. 
16  This is what Jehovah says: “Stand at the crossroads and see. Ask about the ancient roadways,Ask where the good way is, and walk in it,+And find rest for yourselves.”* But they say: “We will not walk in it.”+ 
17  “And I appointed watchmen+ who said,‘Pay attention to the sound of the horn!’”+ But they said: “We will not pay attention.”+ 
18  “Therefore hear, O nations! And know, O assembly,What will happen to them. 
19  Listen, O earth! I am bringing calamity on this people+As the fruitage of their own schemes,For they paid no attention to my wordsAnd they rejected my law.”* 
20  “What do I care that you bring frankincense from SheʹbaAnd sweet cane* from a distant land? Your whole burnt offerings are not acceptable,And your sacrifices do not please me.”+ 
21  Therefore this is what Jehovah says: “Here I am setting for this people stumbling blocks,And they will stumble over them,Fathers and sons together,A neighbor and his companion,And they will all perish.”+ 
22  This is what Jehovah says: “Look! A people is coming from the land of the north,And a great nation will be awakened from the remotest parts of the earth.+ 
23  They will grab hold of the bow and the javelin. They are cruel and will have no mercy. Their voice will roar like the sea,And they ride on horses.+ They draw up in battle order like a man of war against you, O daughter of Zion.” 
24  We have heard the report about it. Our hands fall limp;+Distress has seized us,Anguish* like that of a woman giving birth.+ 
25  Do not go out into the field,And do not walk on the road,For the enemy has a sword;There is terror all around. 
26  O daughter of my people,Put on sackcloth+ and roll in the ashes. Mourn as for an only son, with bitter wailing,+For suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.+ 
27  “I have made you* a metal tester among my people,One making a thorough search;You must take note and examine their way. 
28  All of them are the most stubborn men,+Walking about as slanderers.+ They are like copper and iron;All of them are corrupt. 
29  The bellows have been scorched. Out from their fire there is lead. One keeps refining intensely simply for nothing,+And those who are bad have not been separated.+ 
30  Rejected silver is what people will certainly call them,For Jehovah has rejected them.”+
