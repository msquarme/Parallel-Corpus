35  The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:
2  “Son of man, turn your face toward the mountainous region of Seʹir,+ and prophesy against it.+
3  Say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Here I am against you, O mountainous region of Seʹir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate wasteland.+
4  I will turn your cities into ruins, and you will become a desolate wasteland;+ and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.
5  For you showed unrelenting hostility,+ and you gave the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their disaster, at the time of their final punishment.”’+ 
6  “‘Therefore as surely as I am alive,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘I will prepare you for bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you.+ Since it was blood that you hated, bloodshed will pursue you.+
7  I will make the mountainous region of Seʹir a desolate wasteland,+ and I will cut off from it anyone passing through and anyone returning.
8  I will fill its mountains with the slain; and those slain by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your streams.
9  I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited;+ and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.’ 
10  “Because you said, ‘These two nations and these two lands will become mine, and we will take possession of both,’+ even though Jehovah himself was there,
11  ‘therefore as surely as I am alive,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘I will deal with you according to the same anger and jealousy that you displayed in your hatred toward them;+ and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.
12  You will then have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have heard all the insolent things you spoke against the mountains of Israel when you said, “They have been laid desolate and have been given to us to devour.”*
13  And you spoke arrogantly against me, and you multiplied your words against me.+ I heard it all.’ 
14  “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘The whole earth will rejoice when I will make you a desolate wasteland.
15  Just as you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel was laid desolate, that is how I will deal with you.+ You will become a desolate ruin, O mountainous region of Seʹir, yes, all of Eʹdom;+ and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’”
