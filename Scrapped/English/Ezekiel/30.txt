30  And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:
2  “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Wail, ‘Alas, the day is coming!’ 
 3  For the day is near, yes, a day of Jehovah is near.+ It will be a day of clouds,+ an appointed time of nations.+ 
 4  A sword will come against Egypt, and panic will overtake E·thi·oʹpi·a when the slain fall in Egypt;Its wealth is taken and its foundations are torn down.+ 
 5  E·thi·oʹpi·a,+ Put,+ Lud, and all the mixed populations,*And Chub, along with the sons of the land of the covenant,*By the sword they will all fall.”’ 
 6  This is what Jehovah says: ‘The supporters of Egypt will also fall,And its arrogant power will be brought down.’+ “‘From Migʹdol+ to Sy·eʹne+ they will fall by the sword in the land,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.
7  ‘They will be made the most desolate of lands, and its own cities will become the most devastated cities.+
8  And they will have to know that I am Jehovah when I set a fire in Egypt and all its allies are crushed.
9  In that day I will send messengers in ships to make self-confident E·thi·oʹpi·a tremble; panic will seize them in the day that is coming upon Egypt, for it will surely come.’ 
10  “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘I will bring an end to Egypt’s hordes by the hand of King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar* of Babylon.+
11  He and his troops, the most ruthless of the nations,+ will be brought in to destroy the land. They will draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain.+
12  I will turn the canals of the Nile+ into dry ground and will sell the land into the hand of wicked men. I will make the land and everything in it desolate by the hand of foreigners.+ I myself, Jehovah, have spoken.’ 
13  “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘I will also destroy the disgusting idols* and bring an end to the worthless gods of Noph.*+ There will no longer be a prince* from the land of Egypt, and I will put fear in the land of Egypt.+
14  I will desolate Pathʹros+ and set a fire in Zoʹan and execute judgment on No.*+
15  I will pour out my rage on Sin, the stronghold of Egypt, and destroy the population of No.
16  I will set a fire in Egypt; and Sin will be seized with terror and No will be broken through and Noph* will face attack in broad daylight!
17  The young men of On* and Pi·beʹseth will fall by the sword, and the cities will go into captivity.
18  In Te·haphʹne·hes the day will grow dark when I break the yoke bars of Egypt there.+ Her arrogant power will come to an end,+ clouds will cover her, and her towns will go into captivity.+
19  I will execute judgment on Egypt, and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” 
20  And in the 11th year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:
21  “Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharʹaoh king of Egypt; it will not be bound up to be healed or wrapped with a bandage to make it strong enough to take up the sword.” 
22  “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Here I am against Pharʹaoh king of Egypt,+ and I will break his arms, the strong one and the broken one,+ and I will make the sword fall from his hand.+
23  Then I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands.+
24  I will strengthen the arms* of the king of Babylon+ and put my sword into his hand,+ and I will break the arms of Pharʹaoh, and he will groan loudly like a dying man before him.*
25  I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharʹaoh will fall limp; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he wields it against the land of Egypt.+
26  And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands,+ and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’”
