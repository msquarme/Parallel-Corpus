22  And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:
2  “As for you, son of man, are you prepared to pronounce judgment on* the bloodguilty city+ and to make known to her all her detestable things?+
3  You are to say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “O city that sheds blood+ within herself, whose time is coming,+ who makes disgusting idols* to defile herself,+
4  your bloodshed has made you guilty,+ and your disgusting idols have made you unclean.+ You have hastened the end of your days, and the end of your years has come. That is why I will make you an object of reproach to the nations and an object of mockery to all the lands.+
5  The lands nearby and those far away from you will mock you,+ you whose name is unclean and who are filled with turmoil.
6  Look! Each of the chieftains of Israel among you uses his authority to shed blood.+
7  Within you they treat their father and mother with contempt.+ They defraud the foreign resident, and they mistreat the fatherless child* and the widow.”’”+ 
8  “‘My holy places you despise, and my sabbaths you profane.+
9  Within you are slanderers intent on shedding blood.+ Within you they eat sacrifices on the mountains and carry on obscene conduct in your midst.+
10  Within you they dishonor their father’s bed,*+ and they violate a woman unclean in her menstruation.+
11  Within you one man acts detestably with his neighbor’s wife,+ another defiles his own daughter-in-law with obscene conduct,+ and another violates his sister, the daughter of his own father.+
12  Within you they take a bribe to shed blood.+ You lend on interest+ or for a profit,* and you extort money from your neighbors.+ Yes, you have entirely forgotten me,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 
13  “‘Look! I clap my hands in disgust at the dishonest gain you have made and over the acts of bloodshed in your midst.
14  Will your courage* endure and your hands remain strong in the days when I take action against you?+ I myself, Jehovah, have spoken, and I will take action.
15  I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you among the lands,+ and I will put an end to your uncleanness.+
16  And you will be dishonored before the nations, and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.’”+ 
17  And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:
18  “Son of man, the house of Israel has become like worthless dross to me. All of them are copper and tin and iron and lead in a furnace. They have become the dross of silver.+ 
19  “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Because all of you have become like worthless dross,+ I am collecting you together inside Jerusalem.
20  Just as silver and copper and iron and lead and tin are collected inside a furnace in order to blow fire upon them and melt them, so I will collect you together in my anger and in my rage, and I will blow upon you and make you melt.+
21  I will bring you together and blow upon you with the fire of my fury,+ and you will be melted inside of her.+
22  Just as silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her; and you will have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have poured out my rage on you.’” 
23  And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:
24  “Son of man, say to her, ‘You are a land that will not be cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation.
25  Her prophets have conspired within her,+ like a roaring lion tearing prey.+ They are devouring people.* They are seizing treasure and precious things. They have made many widows within her.
26  Her priests have violated my law,+ and they keep profaning my holy places.+ They make no distinction between what is holy and what is common,+ and they fail to make known what is unclean and what is clean,+ and they refuse to observe my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
27  Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing prey; they shed blood and kill people* to make dishonest gain.+
28  But her prophets have plastered over their deeds with whitewash. They see false visions and give lying divination,+ and they say: “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says,” when Jehovah himself has not spoken.
29  The people of the land have defrauded and committed robbery,+ they have mistreated the needy and the poor, and they have defrauded the foreign resident and denied him justice.’ 
30  “‘I was looking for a man from among them who would repair the stone wall or stand before me in the breach in behalf of the land, so that it would not be destroyed,+ but I found no one.
31  So I will pour out my indignation on them and exterminate them with the fire of my fury. I will bring the consequences of their way on their own head,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”
