4  In the final part of the days,*The mountain of the house of Jehovah+Will become firmly established above the top of the mountains,And it will be raised up above the hills,And to it peoples will stream.+ 
 2  And many nations will go and say: “Come, let us go up to the mountain of JehovahAnd to the house of the God of Jacob.+ He will instruct us about his ways,And we will walk in his paths.” For law* will go out of Zion,And the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem. 
 3  He will render judgment among many peoples+And set matters straight* respecting mighty nations far away. They will beat their swords into plowsharesAnd their spears into pruning shears.+ Nation will not lift up sword against nation,Nor will they learn war anymore.+ 
 4  They will sit,* each one under his vine and under his fig tree,+And no one will make them afraid,+For the mouth of Jehovah of armies has spoken. 
 5  For all the peoples will walk, each in the name of its god,But we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God+ forever and ever. 
 6  “In that day,” declares Jehovah,“I will gather the one* who was limping,And collect together the dispersed one,+Along with those I treated harshly. 
 7  I will make the one* who was limping a remnant,+And the one far removed a mighty nation;+And Jehovah will rule as king over them in Mount Zion,From now on and forever. 
 8  As for you, O tower of the flock,The mound of the daughter of Zion,+To you it will come, yes, the first* dominion will come,+The kingdom belonging to the daughter of Jerusalem.+ 
 9  Now why are you shouting loudly? Have you no king,Or has your adviser perished,So that pain has seized you like a woman giving birth?+ 
10  Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion,Like a woman giving birth,For now you will go from the city and reside in the field. You will go as far as to Babylon,+And there you will be rescued;+There Jehovah will buy you back from the hand of your enemies.+ 
11  Now many nations will be gathered against you;They will say, ‘Let her be defiled,And let our eyes see this happen to Zion.’ 
12  But they do not know the thoughts of Jehovah,They do not understand his purpose;*For he will gather them like a row of newly cut grain to the threshing floor. 
13  Get up and thresh, O daughter of Zion;+For I will change your horns into iron,And I will change your hooves into copper,And you will pulverize many peoples.+ You will devote their dishonest profit to Jehovah,And their resources to the true Lord of the whole earth.”+
