7  Woe to me! I am like one who,After the gathering of summer fruitAnd the gleaning following a grape harvest,Finds no cluster of grapes to eat,No early fig that I crave.* 
 2  The loyal one has perished* from the earth;Among men there is no one upright.+ All of them lie in ambush for bloodshed.+ Each hunts his own brother with a dragnet. 
 3  Their hands are expert at doing what is bad;+The prince is making demands,The judge asks for a reward,+The prominent one makes known his desires,*+And they work it out together.* 
 4  Their best one is like thorns,Their most upright one is worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen and of your reckoning will come.+ Now they will panic.+ 
 5  Do not put faith in your companionOr trust a close friend.+ Guard what you say to the one who lies in your embrace. 
 6  For a son despises his father,A daughter rises up against her mother,+And a daughter-in-law is against her mother-in-law;+A man’s enemies are the men of his household.+ 
 7  But as for me, I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah.+ I will show a waiting attitude* for the God of my salvation.+ My God will hear me.+ 
 8  Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy.* Although I have fallen, I will rise up;Although I dwell in the darkness, Jehovah will be my light. 
 9  The wrath of Jehovah I will bear—For I have sinned against him+—Until he pleads my legal case and brings about justice for me. He will bring me out to the light;I will look upon his righteousness. 
10  My enemy will also see,And shame will cover her who said to me: “Where is Jehovah your God?”+ My eyes will look upon her. Now she will be trampled like mud in the streets. 
11  It will be a day for building your stone walls;On that day the boundary will be extended.* 
12  On that day they will come to youAll the way from As·syrʹi·a and the cities of Egypt,From Egypt all the way to the River;*From sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.+ 
13  And the land will become desolate because of its inhabitants,As a result of what they have done.* 
14  Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance,+The one who was living alone in a forest—in the midst of an orchard. Let them feed on Baʹshan and Gilʹe·ad+ as in the days of old. 
15  “As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt,I will show him wonderful things.+ 
16  Nations will see and be ashamed despite all their might.+ They will put their hand over their mouth;Their ears will become deaf. 
17  They will lick the dust like serpents;+Like the reptiles of the earth they will come trembling out of their strongholds. To Jehovah our God they will come in dread,And they will be in fear of you.”+ 
18  Who is a God like you,Pardoning error and passing over the transgression+ of the remnant of his inheritance?+ He will not hold onto his anger forever,For he delights in loyal love.+ 
19  He will again show us mercy;+ he will conquer* our errors. You will throw all their sins into the depths of the sea.+ 
20  You will show faithfulness to Jacob,Loyal love to Abraham,As you swore to our forefathers from the days of old.+
