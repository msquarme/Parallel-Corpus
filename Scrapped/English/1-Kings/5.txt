5  When Hiʹram the king of Tyre+ heard that Solʹo·mon had been anointed as king in place of his father, he sent his servants to Solʹo·mon, for Hiʹram had always been a friend of David’s.*+
2  In turn Solʹo·mon sent word to Hiʹram:+
3  “You well know that David my father was not able to build a house for the name of Jehovah his God because of the wars waged against him from every side until Jehovah put his enemies under the soles of his feet.+
4  But now Jehovah my God has given me rest on all sides.+ There is no one opposing me and nothing bad happening.+
5  So I intend to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, just as Jehovah promised to David my father, saying: ‘Your son whom I will put on your throne in your place, he is the one who will build the house for my name.’+
6  Now command your people to cut cedars of Lebʹa·non+ for me. My servants will work with your servants, and I will pay the wages of your servants according to the rate you set, for you are aware that not one of us knows how to cut trees like the Si·doʹni·ans.”+ 
7  When Hiʹram heard Solʹo·mon’s words, he rejoiced greatly and said: “May Jehovah be praised today, for he has given David a wise son over this great* people!”+
8  So Hiʹram sent word to Solʹo·mon: “I have heard the message you sent to me. I will do all you desire in providing the cedar and juniper timbers.+
9  My servants will bring them down from Lebʹa·non to the sea, and I will make them into log rafts to go by sea to the place that you designate to me. I will have them broken up there, and you can carry them away. In exchange, you will provide the food that I request for my household.”+ 
10  So Hiʹram supplied all the timbers of cedar and juniper that Solʹo·mon desired.
11  And Solʹo·mon gave Hiʹram 20,000 cor measures* of wheat as food supplies for his household and 20 cor measures of very fine olive oil.* That was what Solʹo·mon gave Hiʹram year after year.+
12  And Jehovah gave Solʹo·mon wisdom, just as He had promised him.+ And there was peace between Hiʹram and Solʹo·mon, and the two of them made a treaty.* 
13  King Solʹo·mon conscripted men for forced labor out of all Israel; 30,000 men were conscripted.+
14  He would send them to Lebʹa·non in shifts of 10,000 each month. They would spend a month in Lebʹa·non and two months at their homes; and Ad·o·niʹram+ was over those conscripted for forced labor.
15  Solʹo·mon had 70,000 common laborers* and 80,000 stonecutters+ in the mountains,+
16  as well as Solʹo·mon’s 3,300 princely deputies+ who served as foremen to supervise the workmen.
17  At the king’s order, they quarried large stones, expensive stones,+ to lay the foundation+ of the house with hewn stones.+
18  So Solʹo·mon’s builders and Hiʹram’s builders and the Geʹbal·ites+ did the cutting, and they prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house.
