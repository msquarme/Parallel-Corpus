5  Come, now, you rich men, weep and wail over the miseries that are coming upon you.+
2  Your riches have rotted, and your clothing has become moth-eaten.+
3  Your gold and silver have rusted away, and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh. What you have stored up will be like a fire in the last days.+
4  Look! The wages you have withheld from the workers who harvested your fields keep crying out, and the cries for help of the reapers have reached the ears of Jehovah* of armies.+
5  You have lived in luxury and for self-gratification on the earth. You have fattened your hearts on the day of slaughter.+
6  You have condemned; you have murdered the righteous one. Is he not opposing you? 
7  Be patient then, brothers, until the presence of the Lord.+ Look! The farmer keeps waiting for the precious fruit of the earth, exercising patience over it until the early rain and the late rain arrive.+
8  You too exercise patience;+ make your hearts firm, because the presence of the Lord has drawn close.+ 
9  Do not grumble* against one another, brothers, so that you do not get judged.+ Look! The Judge is standing before the doors.
10  Brothers, take as a pattern of the suffering of evil+ and the exercising of patience+ the prophets who spoke in the name of Jehovah.*+
11  Look! We consider happy* those who have endured.+ You have heard of the endurance of Job+ and have seen the outcome Jehovah* gave,+ that Jehovah* is very tender in affection* and merciful.+ 
12  Above all, my brothers, stop swearing, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath. But let your “Yes” mean yes and your “No,” no,+ so that you do not become liable to judgment. 
13  Is there anyone suffering hardship among you? Let him carry on prayer.+ Is there anyone in good spirits? Let him sing psalms.+
14  Is there anyone sick among you? Let him call the elders+ of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, applying oil to him+ in the name of Jehovah.*
15  And the prayer of faith will make the sick one* well, and Jehovah* will raise him up. Also, if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. 
16  Therefore, openly confess your sins+ to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. A righteous man’s supplication has a powerful effect.*+
17  E·liʹjah was a man with feelings like ours, and yet when he prayed earnestly for it not to rain, it did not rain on the land for three years and six months.+
18  Then he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the land produced fruit.+ 
19  My brothers, if anyone among you is led astray from the truth and another turns him back,
20  know that whoever turns a sinner back from the error+ of his way will save him* from death and will cover a multitude of sins.+
