3  In the same way, you wives, be in subjection to your husbands,+ so that if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives,+
2  because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct+ together with deep respect.
3  Do not let your adornment be external—the braiding of hair and the wearing of gold ornaments+ or fine clothing—
4  but let it be the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of the quiet and mild spirit,+ which is of great value in the eyes of God.
5  For this is how the holy women of the past who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, subjecting themselves to their husbands,
6  just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord.+ And you have become her children, provided you continue doing good and do not give in to fear.+ 
7  You husbands, in the same way, continue dwelling with them according to knowledge.* Assign them honor+ as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since they are also heirs with you+ of the undeserved favor of life, in order for your prayers not to be hindered. 
8  Finally, all of you have unity of mind,*+ fellow feeling, brotherly affection, tender compassion,+ and humility.+
9  Do not pay back injury for injury+ or insult for insult.+ Instead, repay with a blessing,+ for you were called to this course, so that you might inherit a blessing. 
10  For “whoever would love life and see good days must guard his tongue from bad+ and his lips from speaking deception.
11  Let him turn away from what is bad+ and do what is good;+ let him seek peace and pursue it.+
12  For the eyes of Jehovah* are on the righteous, and his ears listen to their supplication,+ but the face of Jehovah* is against those doing bad things.”+ 
13  Indeed, who will harm you if you become zealous for what is good?+
14  But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy.+ However, do not fear what they fear,* nor be disturbed.+
15  But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper+ and deep respect.+ 
16  Maintain a good conscience,+ so that in whatever way you are spoken against, those who speak against you may be put to shame+ because of your good conduct as followers of Christ.+
17  For it is better to suffer because you are doing good,+ if it is God’s will to allow it, than because you are doing evil.+
18  For Christ died once for all time for sins,+ a righteous person for unrighteous ones,+ in order to lead you to God.+ He was put to death in the flesh+ but made alive in the spirit.+
19  And in this state he went and preached to the spirits in prison,+
20  who had formerly been disobedient when God was patiently waiting* in Noah’s day,+ while the ark was being constructed,+ in which a few people, that is, eight souls,* were carried safely through the water.+ 
21  Baptism, which corresponds to this, is also now saving you (not by the removing of the filth of the flesh, but by the request to God for a good conscience),+ through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
22  He is at God’s right hand,+ for he went to heaven, and angels and authorities and powers were made subject to him.+
