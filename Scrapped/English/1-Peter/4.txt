4  Since Christ suffered in the flesh,+ you too arm yourselves with the same mental disposition;* because the person who has suffered in the flesh has desisted from sins,+
2  so that he may live the remainder of his time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men,+ but for God’s will.+
3  For the time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have done the will of the nations+ when you carried on in acts of brazen conduct,* unbridled passions, overdrinking, wild parties,* drinking bouts, and lawless idolatries.+
4  They are puzzled that you do not continue running with them in the same decadent course of debauchery, so they speak abusively of you.+
5  But these people will render an account to the one who is ready to judge those living and those dead.+
6  In fact, this is why the good news was declared also to the dead,+ so that although they are judged in the flesh from the standpoint of men, they might live in harmony with the spirit from God’s standpoint. 
7  But the end of all things has drawn close. Therefore, be sound in mind,+ and be vigilant* with a view to prayers.+
8  Above all things, have intense love for one another,+ because love covers a multitude of sins.+
9  Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.+
10  To the extent that each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness that is expressed in various ways.+
11  If anyone speaks, let him do so as speaking pronouncements from God; if anyone ministers, let him do so as depending on the strength that God supplies;+ so that in all things God may be glorified+ through Jesus Christ. The glory and the might are his forever and ever. Amen. 
12  Beloved ones, do not be surprised about the fiery trials that you are experiencing,+ as though something strange were happening to you.
13  On the contrary, go on rejoicing+ over the extent to which you are sharers in the sufferings of the Christ,+ so that you may rejoice and be overjoyed also during the revelation of his glory.+
14  If you are being reproached* for the name of Christ, you are happy,+ because the spirit of glory, yes, the spirit of God, is resting upon you. 
15  However, let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or a wrongdoer or a busybody in other people’s matters.+
16  But if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not feel ashamed,+ but let him keep on glorifying God while bearing this name.
17  For it is the appointed time for the judgment to start with the house of God.+ Now if it starts first with us,+ what will the outcome be for those who are not obedient to the good news of God?+
18  “And if the righteous man is being saved with difficulty, what will happen to the ungodly man and the sinner?”+
19  So, then, let those who are suffering in harmony with the will of God keep on entrusting* themselves* to a faithful Creator while they are doing good.+
