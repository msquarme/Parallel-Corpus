7  “At the time when I would heal Israel,The error of Eʹphra·im is also exposed,+And the wickedness of Sa·marʹi·a.+ For they practice deception;+Thieves break in and marauder bands raid outside.+ 
 2  But they do not say in their heart that I will remember all their wickedness.+ Now their dealings are all around them;They are right in front of my face. 
 3  They make the king rejoice by their wickedness,And princes by their deceit. 
 4  All of them are adulterers,Burning like an oven fired by a baker,Who stops stirring the fire after kneading the dough until it is leavened. 
 5  On the day of our king, princes have become sick—They are enraged because of wine.+ He has reached out his hand to ridiculers. 
 6  For they approach with hearts burning like an oven.* All night long the baker sleeps;In the morning the oven blazes like a flaming fire. 
 7  All of them are hot like an oven,And they devour their rulers.* All their kings have fallen;+No one among them calls out to me.+ 
 8  Eʹphra·im mixes with the nations.+ Eʹphra·im is like a round cake left unturned. 
 9  Strangers have consumed his strength,+ but he does not know it. And his gray hairs have turned white, but he does not notice it. 
10  The pride of Israel has testified against him,+But they have not returned to Jehovah their God,+Nor have they looked for him despite all of this. 
11  Eʹphra·im is like a simpleminded dove, lacking good sense.*+ They have called out to Egypt;+ they have gone to As·syrʹi·a.+ 
12  Wherever they go, I will spread my net over them. I will bring them down like the birds of the heavens. I will discipline them according to the warning given to their assembly.+ 
13  Woe to them, for they have fled from me! Devastation to them, for they have transgressed against me! I was ready to redeem them, but they have spoken lies against me.+ 
14  From their heart they did not call to me for help,+Although they kept wailing on their beds. For their grain and new wine they would slash themselves;They turn against me. 
15  Although I disciplined them and strengthened their arms,They are against me, scheming what is bad. 
16  They changed course, but not to anything loftier;*They were as unreliable as a loose bow.+ Their princes will fall by the sword because of their defiant tongues. For this they will be an object of ridicule in the land of Egypt.”+
