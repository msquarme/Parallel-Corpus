1  The word of Jehovah that came to Ho·seʹa* the son of Be·eʹri in the days of Uz·ziʹah,+ Joʹtham,+ Aʹhaz,+ and Hez·e·kiʹah,+ kings of Judah,+ and in the days of Jer·o·boʹam+ son of Joʹash,+ the king of Israel.
2  When Jehovah started to speak his word through Ho·seʹa, Jehovah said to Ho·seʹa: “Go, marry a woman of prostitution* and have children of prostitution,* because by prostitution* the land has turned completely away from following Jehovah.”+ 
3  So he went and married Goʹmer the daughter of Dib·laʹim, and she conceived and bore him a son. 
4  Then Jehovah said to him: “Name him Jezʹre·el,* for in a little while I will hold an accounting against the house of Jeʹhu+ for the acts of bloodshed of Jezʹre·el, and I will put an end to the royal rule of the house of Israel.+
5  In that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley* of Jezʹre·el.” 
6  She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And He told him: “Name her Lo-ru·haʹmah,* for I will no longer show mercy+ to the house of Israel, because I will certainly drive them away.+
7  But I will show mercy to the house of Judah,+ and I will save them by Jehovah their God;+ I will not save them by bow or by sword or by war or by horses or by horsemen.”+ 
8  After weaning Lo-ru·haʹmah, she conceived and gave birth to a son.
9  Then He said: “Name him Lo-amʹmi,* because you are not my people and I will not be yours. 
10  “And the number of the people* of Israel will be like the grains of sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered.+ And in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’+ it will be said to them, ‘The sons of the living God.’+
11  And the people of Judah and of Israel will be gathered together into unity+ and will choose for themselves one head and go up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezʹre·el.+
