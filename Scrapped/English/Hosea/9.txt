9  “Do not rejoice, O Israel,+Do not act joyfully like the peoples. For by prostitution* you have strayed from your God.+ You have loved the wages of a prostitute on every threshing floor of grain.+ 
 2  But the threshing floor and winepress will not feed them,And new wine will fail her.+ 
 3  They will not continue dwelling in the land of Jehovah;+Instead, Eʹphra·im will return to Egypt,And in As·syrʹi·a they will eat what is unclean.+ 
 4  They will no longer pour out wine offerings to Jehovah;+Their sacrifices will not please him.+ They are like the bread of mourning;All those eating it will defile themselves. For their bread is for themselves alone;*It will not come into the house of Jehovah. 
 5  What will you do in the day of meeting,*In the day of Jehovah’s festival? 
 6  For look! they will have to flee because of destruction.+ Egypt will gather them together,+ and Memʹphis will bury them.+ Nettles will take possession of their precious things of silver,And thornbushes will be in their tents. 
 7  The days of reckoning will come,+The days of retribution will come,And Israel will know it. Their prophet will be a fool, and the man of inspiration will go mad;Because your error is abundant, the animosity against you is abundant.” 
 8  The watchman+ of Eʹphra·im was with my God.+ But now all the ways of his prophets+ are as the traps of a birdcatcher;There is animosity in the house of his God. 
 9  They have sunk deep into ruin, as in the days of Gibʹe·ah.+ He will remember their error and punish their sins.+ 
10  “Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel.+ Like the first of the early figs on a fig tree I saw your forefathers. But they went to Baʹal of Peʹor;+They dedicated themselves to the shameful thing,*+And they became disgusting like the object of their love. 
11  Eʹphra·im’s glory flies away like a bird;There is no giving birth, no pregnancy, and no conception.+ 
12  Even if they raise children,I will bereave them until no man is left;+Yes, woe to them when I turn away from them!+ 
13  Eʹphra·im, planted in a pasture, was to me like Tyre;+Now Eʹphra·im must bring his sons out to the slaughter.” 
14  Give them, O Jehovah, what you should give them;A womb that miscarries and dry* breasts. 
15  “All their wickedness was in Gilʹgal,+ for there I came to hate them. I will drive them away from my house because of their evil deeds.+ I will no longer love them;+All their princes are stubborn. 
16  Eʹphra·im will be struck down.+ Their root will dry up, and they will produce no fruit. Even if they give birth, I will put to death their cherished offspring.” 
17  My God will reject them,For they have not listened to him,+And they will become fugitives among the nations.+
