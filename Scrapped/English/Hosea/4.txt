4  Hear the word of Jehovah, O people of Israel,For Jehovah has a legal case against the inhabitants of the land,+Because there is no truth nor loyal love nor knowledge of God in the land.+ 
 2  False oaths and lying+ and murder+And stealing and adultery+ are widespread,And one act of bloodshed follows another act of bloodshed.+ 
 3  That is why the land will mourn+And every inhabitant in it will waste away;The wild animals of the field and the birds of the heavens,Even the fish of the sea, will perish. 
 4  “However, let no man contend or reprove,+For your people are like those who contend against a priest.+ 
 5  So you will stumble in broad daylight,And the prophet will stumble with you, as if it were night. And I will silence* your mother. 
 6  My people will be silenced,* because there is no knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge,+I will also reject you from serving as my priest;And because you have forgotten the law* of your God,+I myself will forget your sons. 
 7  The more they increased, the more they sinned against me.+ I will change their glory into disgrace.* 
 8  They feed on the sin of my people,And they are greedy for* their error. 
 9  It will be the same for the people as for the priest;I will call them to account for their ways,And I will bring on them the consequences of their actions.+ 
10  They will eat but not be satisfied.+ They will be promiscuous,* but they will not increase,+Because they have shown no regard for Jehovah. 
11  Prostitution* and wine and new wineTake away the motivation to do what is right.*+ 
12  My people consult their wooden idols,Doing what their staff* tells them;Because the spirit of prostitution* causes them to go astray,And by their prostitution* they refuse to submit to their God. 
13  On the tops of the mountains they sacrifice,+And on the hills they make sacrifices smoke,Under oak trees and storax trees and every big tree,+Because their shade is good. That is why your daughters commit prostitution*And your daughters-in-law commit adultery. 
14  I will not hold an accounting against your daughters because of their prostitution,*And against your daughters-in-law because of their adultery. For the men go off with the harlotsAnd sacrifice with the temple prostitutes;Such a people without understanding+ will come to ruin. 
15  Although you are committing prostitution,* O Israel,+Let not Judah become guilty.+ Do not come to Gilʹgal+ or to Beth-aʹven,+And do not swear, ‘As surely as Jehovah is alive!’+ 
16  For like a stubborn cow, Israel has become stubborn.+ Will Jehovah now shepherd them like a young ram in an open pasture?* 
17  Eʹphra·im is joined to idols.+ Let him alone! 
18  When their beer* is finished,They become promiscuous.* And her rulers* dearly love dishonor.+ 
19  The wind will wrap her* in its wings,And they will be ashamed of their sacrifices.”
