10  Jehovah then said to Moses:
2  “Make two trumpets+ for yourself; make them of hammered silver, and use them to summon the assembly and to break up the camps.
3  When both of them are blown, the whole assembly must be summoned to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting.+
4  If just one is blown, only the chieftains, the heads of the thousands of Israel, will be summoned to you.+ 
5  “When you sound a fluctuating trumpet blast, the camps of those to the east+ should depart.
6  When you sound a fluctuating trumpet blast a second time, the camps of those to the south+ should depart. They should sound the trumpet blasts in this way each time one of them departs. 
7  “Now when calling the congregation together, you should blow the trumpets,+ but not with fluctuating blasts.
8  Aaron’s sons, the priests, should blow the trumpets,+ and the use of them will serve as a lasting statute for you throughout your generations. 
9  “If you should go to war in your land against an oppressor who is harassing you, you should sound a war call on the trumpets,+ and you will be remembered by Jehovah your God and be saved from your enemies. 
10  “Also, on your joyous occasions+—your festivals+ and at the beginning of your months—you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings+ and your communion sacrifices;+ they will serve as a reminder for you before your God. I am Jehovah your God.”+ 
11  Now in the second year, in the second month, on the 20th day of the month,+ the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle+ of the Testimony.
12  So the Israelites began to pull away from the wilderness of Siʹnai in the order established for their departure,+ and the cloud settled in the wilderness of Paʹran.+
13  This was the first time they departed following the order of Jehovah through Moses.+ 
14  So the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of Judah departed first by their companies,* and Nahʹshon+ the son of Am·minʹa·dab was over its company.
15  Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Isʹsa·char was Ne·thanʹel+ the son of Zuʹar.
16  Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Zebʹu·lun was E·liʹab+ the son of Heʹlon. 
17  When the tabernacle was taken down,+ the sons of Gerʹshon+ and the sons of Me·rarʹi,+ who carried the tabernacle, departed. 
18  Then the three-tribe division of the camp of Reuʹben departed by their companies,* and E·liʹzur+ the son of Shedʹe·ur was over its company.
19  Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Simʹe·on was She·luʹmi·el+ the son of Zu·ri·shadʹdai.
20  Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Gad was E·liʹa·saph+ the son of Deuʹel. 
21  Then the Koʹhath·ites, who carried the sanctuary items,+ departed. The tabernacle was to be set up by the time they arrived. 
22  Then the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of Eʹphra·im departed by their companies,* and E·lishʹa·ma+ the son of Am·miʹhud was over its company.
23  Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Ma·nasʹseh was Ga·maʹli·el+ the son of Pe·dahʹzur.
24  Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abʹi·dan+ the son of Gid·e·oʹni. 
25  Then the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of Dan departed by their companies,* forming the rear guard for all the camps, and A·hi·eʹzer+ the son of Am·mi·shadʹdai was over its company.
26  Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Ashʹer was Paʹgi·el+ the son of Ochʹran.
27  Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Naphʹta·li was A·hiʹra+ the son of Eʹnan.
28  This was the order of departure that the Israelites and their companies* followed when they would depart.+ 
29  Then Moses said to Hoʹbab the son of Reuʹel*+ the Midʹi·an·ite, the father-in-law of Moses: “We are setting out for the place about which Jehovah said, ‘I will give it to you.’+ Do come with us,+ and we will treat you well, because Jehovah has promised good things for Israel.”+
30  But he said to him: “I will not go. I will return to my own country and to my relatives.”
31  At this he said: “Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our guide.*
32  And if you do come with us,+ whatever goodness Jehovah shows to us, we will surely show to you.” 
33  So they began marching from the mountain of Jehovah+ for a journey of three days, and the ark+ of Jehovah’s covenant traveled before them for the three-day journey to search out a resting-place for them.+
34  And Jehovah’s cloud+ was over them by day when they set out from the encampment. 
35  Whenever the Ark was moved, Moses would say: “Rise up, O Jehovah,+ and let your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate you flee from before you.”
36  And when it would rest, he would say: “Do return, O Jehovah, to the countless* thousands of Israel.”+
