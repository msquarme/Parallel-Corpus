15  Those registered in his army are 45,650.+ 
16  “All those registered in the armies of the camp of Reuʹben are 151,450, and they should break camp second.+ 
17  “When the tent of meeting is moved,+ the camp of the Levites should be in the middle of the other camps. “They should travel in the same order as they encamp,+ with each in his place, according to their three-tribe divisions. 
18  “The three-tribe division of the encampment of Eʹphra·im by their companies* will be toward the west; the chieftain for the sons of Eʹphra·im is E·lishʹa·ma+ the son of Am·miʹhud.

32  These were the Israelites who were registered according to their paternal houses; the total of those in the camps registered for the army was 603,550.+
33  But the Levites did not get registered+ along with the other Israelites,+ just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
34  The Israelites did everything that Jehovah had commanded Moses. This is how they encamped by their three-tribe divisions+ and how they broke camp,+ each by family and according to their paternal houses.
