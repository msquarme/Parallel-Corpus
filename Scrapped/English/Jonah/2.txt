2  Then Joʹnah prayed to Jehovah his God from the belly of the fish,+
2  and he said: “Out of my distress I called out to Jehovah, and he answered me.+ Out of the depths* of the Grave* I cried for help.+ You heard my voice. 
 3  When you threw me to the depths, into the heart of the open sea,Then the currents engulfed me.+ All your breakers and waves swept over me.+ 
 4  And I said, ‘I have been driven away from your sight! How will I gaze again upon your holy temple?’ 
 5  Waters engulfed me and threatened my life;*+The watery deep closed in on me. Weeds were wrapped around my head. 
 6  To the bottoms of the mountains I sank down. The bars of the earth were closing upon me forever. But out of the pit you brought up my life, O Jehovah my God.+ 
 7  When my life* was ebbing away, Jehovah was the One whom I remembered.+ Then my prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.+ 
 8  Those who are devoted to the worthless idols forsake their source of loyal love.* 
 9  But as for me, with the voice of thanksgiving I will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed, I will pay.+ Salvation is from Jehovah.”+ 
10  In time Jehovah commanded the fish, and it vomited Joʹnah out onto the dry land.
