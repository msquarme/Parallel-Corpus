17  There was a man of the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im+ named Miʹcah.
2  He said to his mother: “The 1,100 silver pieces that were taken from you about which you pronounced a curse, which I heard—look! the silver is with me. I was the one who took it.” At that his mother said: “May Jehovah bless my son.”
3  So he gave the 1,100 pieces of silver back to his mother, but his mother said: “I will without fail sanctify the silver to Jehovah from my hand for my son to use in making a carved image and a metal statue.*+ Now I give it back to you.” 
4  After he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took 200 silver pieces and gave them to the silversmith. He made a carved image and a metal statue;* and they were put in Miʹcah’s house.
5  This man Miʹcah had a house of gods, and he made an ephʹod+ and teraphim statues*+ and installed* one of his sons to serve as priest for him.+
6  In those days, there was no king in Israel.+ Each one was doing what was right in his own eyes.*+ 
7  Now there was a young man of Bethʹle·hem+ in Judah who was of the family of Judah. He was a Levite+ who had been living there for a time.
8  The man left the city of Bethʹle·hem in Judah to find a place to live. While on his journey, he came to the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, to the house of Miʹcah.+
9  Then Miʹcah said to him: “Where do you come from?” He replied: “I am a Levite from Bethʹle·hem in Judah, and I am on my way to find a place to live.”
10  So Miʹcah said to him: “Stay with me and serve as a father* and a priest for me. I will give you ten silver pieces a year and a set of garments and your food.” So the Levite went in.
11  Thus the Levite agreed to stay with the man, and the young man became like one of his sons.
12  Furthermore, Miʹcah installed* the Levite to serve as a priest for him,+ and he lived in the house of Miʹcah.
13  Then Miʹcah said: “Now I know that Jehovah will be good to me, for the Levite has become my priest.”
