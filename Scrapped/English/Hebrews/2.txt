2  That is why it is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things we have heard,+ so that we never drift away.+
2  For if the word spoken through angels+ proved to be sure, and every transgression and disobedient act received a punishment in harmony with justice,+
3  how will we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation?+ For it began to be spoken through our Lord+ and was verified for us by those who heard him,
4  while God joined in bearing witness with signs and wonders* and various powerful works+ and with the holy spirit distributed according to his will.+ 
5  For it is not to angels that he has subjected the inhabited earth to come,+ about which we are speaking.
6  But in one place a certain witness said: “What is man that you keep him in mind, or a son of man that you take care of him?+
7  You made him a little lower than angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and appointed him over the works of your hands.
8  All things you subjected under his feet.”+ By subjecting all things to him,+ God left nothing that is not subject to him.+ Now, though, we do not yet see all things in subjection to him.+
9  But we do see Jesus, who was made a little lower than angels,+ now crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death,+ so that by God’s undeserved kindness he might taste death for everyone.+ 
10  For it was fitting that the one for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory,+ should make the Chief Agent of their salvation+ perfect through sufferings.+
11  For both the one who is sanctifying and those who are being sanctified+ all stem from one,+ and for this reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,+
12  as he says: “I will declare your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will praise you with song.”+
13  And again: “I will put my trust in him.”+ And again: “Look! I and the young children, whom Jehovah* gave me.”+ 
14  Therefore, since the “young children” are sharers of blood and flesh, he also similarly shared in the same things,+ so that through his death he might bring to nothing the one having the means to cause death,+ that is, the Devil,+
15  and that he might set free* all those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death.+
16  For it is not really angels he is assisting, but he is assisting Abraham’s offspring.*+
17  Consequently, he had to become like his “brothers” in all respects,+ so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, in order to offer a propitiatory sacrifice*+ for the sins of the people.+
18  Since he himself has suffered when being put to the test,+ he is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test.+
