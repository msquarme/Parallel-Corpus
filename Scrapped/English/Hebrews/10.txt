10  For since the Law has a shadow+ of the good things to come,+ but not the very substance of the things, it* can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year, make those who approach perfect.+
2  Otherwise, would not the sacrifices have stopped being offered, because those rendering sacred service once cleansed would have no consciousness of sins anymore?
3  On the contrary, these sacrifices are a reminder of sins year after year,+
4  for it is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away. 
5  So when he comes into the world, he says: “‘Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me.
6  You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin offerings.’+
7  Then I said: ‘Look! I have come (in the scroll* it is written about me) to do your will, O God.’”+
8  After first saying: “You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings”—sacrifices that are offered according to the Law—
9  then he says: “Look! I have come to do your will.”+ He does away with what is first in order to establish what is second.
10  By this “will”+ we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.+ 
11  Also, every priest takes his station day after day to offer holy service*+ and to make the same sacrifices often,+ which can never take sins away completely.+
12  But this man offered one sacrifice for sins for all time and sat down at the right hand of God,+
13  from then on waiting until his enemies should be placed as a stool for his feet.+
14  For it is by one sacrificial offering that he has made those who are being sanctified perfect+ for all time.
15  Moreover, the holy spirit also bears witness to us, for after it has said:
16  “‘This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,’ says Jehovah.* ‘I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds I will write them.’”+
17  Then it says: “And I will no longer call their sins and their lawless deeds to mind.”+
18  Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin. 
19  Therefore, brothers, since we have boldness* for the way of entry into the holy place+ by the blood of Jesus,
20  which he opened up* for us as a new and living way through the curtain,+ that is, his flesh,
21  and since we have a great priest over the house of God,+
22  let us approach with sincere hearts and complete faith, having had our hearts sprinkled clean from a wicked conscience+ and our bodies bathed with clean water.+
23  Let us hold firmly the public declaration of our hope without wavering,+ for the one who promised is faithful.
24  And let us consider* one another so as to incite* to love and fine works,+
25  not forsaking our meeting together,+ as some have the custom, but encouraging one another,+ and all the more so as you see the day drawing near.+ 
26  For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth,+ there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left,+
27  but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a burning indignation that is going to consume those in opposition.+
28  Anyone who has disregarded the Law of Moses dies without compassion on the testimony of two or three.+
29  How much greater punishment do you think a person will deserve who has trampled on the Son of God and who has regarded as of ordinary value the blood of the covenant+ by which he was sanctified, and who has outraged the spirit of undeserved kindness with contempt?+
30  For we know the One who said: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” And again: “Jehovah* will judge his people.”+
31  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. 
32  However, keep remembering the former days in which, after you were enlightened,+ you endured a great struggle along with sufferings.
33  At times you were publicly exposed* both to reproaches and to tribulations, and at times you shared* with those who were having such an experience.
34  For you expressed sympathy for those in prison and you accepted joyfully the plundering of your belongings,+ knowing that you yourselves have a better and an enduring possession.+ 
35  Therefore, do not throw away your boldness,* which will be richly rewarded.+
36  For you need endurance,+ so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the fulfillment of the promise.
37  For yet “a very little while,”+ and “the one who is coming will arrive and will not delay.”+
38  “But my righteous one will live by reason of faith,”+ and “if he shrinks back, I have* no pleasure in him.”+
39  Now we are not the sort who shrink back to destruction,+ but the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives.*
