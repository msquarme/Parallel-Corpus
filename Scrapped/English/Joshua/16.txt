16  And the land that fell by lot*+ to the descendants of Joseph+ was from the Jordan at Jerʹi·cho to the waters east of Jerʹi·cho, through the wilderness going up from Jerʹi·cho into the mountainous region of Bethʹel.+
2  It extended from Bethʹel belonging to Luz and continued to the boundary of the Arʹchites at Atʹa·roth,
3  then it went down westward to the boundary of the Japhʹle·tites as far as the boundary of Lower Beth-hoʹron+ and Geʹzer,+ and it ended at the sea. 
4  So Joseph’s descendants,+ Ma·nasʹseh and Eʹphra·im, took possession of their land.+
5  The boundary of the descendants of Eʹphra·im by their families was as follows: The boundary of their inheritance to the east was Atʹa·roth-adʹdar,+ as far as Upper Beth-hoʹron,+
6  and the boundary extended to the sea. Mich·meʹthath+ was on the north, and the boundary went around east to Taʹa·nath-shiʹloh, and it passed on the east to Ja·noʹah.
7  Then it went down from Ja·noʹah to Atʹa·roth and Naʹa·rah and reached to Jerʹi·cho+ and extended to the Jordan.
8  From Tapʹpu·ah+ the boundary continued westward to the Wadi of Kaʹnah, and it ended at the sea.+ This is the inheritance of the tribe of Eʹphra·im by their families;
9  the descendants of Eʹphra·im also had enclave cities in the midst of the inheritance of Ma·nasʹseh,+ all the cities and their settlements. 
10  But they did not drive away the Caʹnaan·ites who were dwelling in Geʹzer,+ and the Caʹnaan·ites continue to dwell among Eʹphra·im to this day+ and have been subjected to forced labor.+
