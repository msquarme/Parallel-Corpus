15  The land allotted*+ to the tribe of Judah for their families extended to the boundary of Eʹdom,+ the wilderness of Zin, to the Negʹeb at its southern end.
2  Their southern boundary ran from the extremity of the Salt Sea,*+ from the bay that faces southward.
3  And it extended south to the ascent of A·krabʹbim,+ passed over to Zin, then went up from the south to Kaʹdesh-barʹne·a,+ over to Hezʹron, up to Adʹdar, and went around toward Karʹka.
4  Then it passed on to Azʹmon+ and extended to the Wadi* of Egypt,+ and the boundary ended at the Sea.* This was their southern boundary. 
5  The eastern boundary was the Salt Sea* up to the end of the Jordan, and the boundary at the northern corner was at the bay of the sea, at the end of the Jordan.+
6  The boundary went up to Beth-hogʹlah+ and passed over at the north of Beth-arʹa·bah,+ and the boundary went up to the stone of Boʹhan+ the son of Reuʹben.
7  The boundary went up to Deʹbir at the Valley* of Aʹchor+ and turned northward to Gilʹgal,+ which is in front of the ascent of A·dumʹmim that is south of the wadi, and the boundary passed over to the waters of En-sheʹmesh+ and ended at En-roʹgel.+
8  The boundary went up to the Valley of the Son of Hinʹnom+ to the slope of the Jebʹu·site+ at the south, that is, Jerusalem,+ and the boundary went up to the top of the mountain that faces the Valley of Hinʹnom to the west, which is at the extremity of the Valley* of Rephʹa·im to the north.
9  And the boundary was marked from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Neph·toʹah+ and extended to the cities of Mount Eʹphron; and the boundary was marked to Baʹal·ah, that is, Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim.+
10  The boundary went around from Baʹal·ah westward to Mount Seʹir and passed over to the slope of Mount Jeʹa·rim at the north, that is, Chesʹa·lon, and it went down to Beth-sheʹmesh+ and passed over to Timʹnah.+
11  And the boundary extended to the slope of Ekʹron+ to the north, and the boundary was marked to Shikʹke·ron and passed over to Mount Baʹal·ah and extended to Jabʹne·el, and the boundary ended at the sea. 
12  The western boundary was at the Great Sea*+ and its coast. This was the boundary of the descendants of Judah by their families on all sides. 
13  And to Caʹleb+ the son of Je·phunʹneh, he gave a share among the descendants of Judah at the order of Jehovah to Joshua, namely, Kirʹi·ath-arʹba (Arʹba was the father of Aʹnak), that is, Hebʹron.+
14  So Caʹleb drove out from there the three sons of Aʹnak:+ Sheʹshai, A·hiʹman, and Talʹmai,+ descendants of Aʹnak.
15  Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Deʹbir.+ (The name of Deʹbir was previously Kirʹi·ath-seʹpher.)
16  Caʹleb then said: “To the man who strikes Kirʹi·ath-seʹpher and captures it, I will give my daughter Achʹsah as a wife.”
17  And Othʹni·el+ the son of Keʹnaz,+ Caʹleb’s brother, captured it. So he gave him his daughter Achʹsah+ as a wife.
18  While she was going home, she urged him to ask her father for a field. Then she dismounted from her donkey.* Caʹleb asked her: “What do you want?”+
19  She said: “Please grant me a blessing, for you have given me a piece of land in the south;* give me also Gulʹloth-maʹim.”* So he gave her Upper Gulʹloth and Lower Gulʹloth. 
20  This was the inheritance of the tribe of Judah by their families.
