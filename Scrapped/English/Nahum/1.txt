1  A pronouncement against Ninʹe·veh:+ The book of the vision of Naʹhum* the Elʹkosh·ite: 
 2  Jehovah is a God who requires exclusive devotion+ and takes vengeance;Jehovah takes vengeance and is ready to express his wrath.+ Jehovah takes vengeance against his foes,And he stores up wrath for his enemies. 
 3  Jehovah is slow to anger+ and great in power,+But by no means will Jehovah hold back due punishment.+ His path is in destructive wind and storm,And the clouds are the dust of his feet.+ 
 4  He rebukes the sea,+ and he dries it up;And he makes all the rivers run dry.+ Baʹshan and Carʹmel wither,+And the blossoms of Lebʹa·non wither. 
 5  Mountains quake because of him,And the hills melt.+ The earth will be in an upheaval because of his face,Along with the land and all those dwelling in it.+ 
 6  Who can stand before his indignation?+ And who can withstand the heat of his anger?+ His wrath will be poured out like fire,And the rocks will be shattered because of him. 
 7  Jehovah is good,+ a stronghold in the day of distress.+ He is mindful of* those seeking refuge in him.+ 
 8  With a sweeping flood he will make a complete extermination of her* place,And darkness will pursue his enemies. 
 9  What will you plot against Jehovah? He is causing a complete extermination. Distress will not arise a second time.+ 
10  For they are interwoven like thorns,And they are like those drunk with beer;*But they will be consumed like dry stubble. 
11  From you will come one who plots evil against Jehovah,Giving worthless advice. 
12  This is what Jehovah says: “Though they were at full strength and numerous,Even so they will be cut down and will pass away.* I have afflicted you,* but I will afflict you no more. 
13  And now I will break his yoke bar from off you,+And I will tear your bonds in two. 
14  Jehovah has commanded concerning you,*‘Your name will not be perpetuated further. I will do away with the carved images and metal statues* from the house* of your gods. I will make a grave for you, because you are contemptible.’ 
15  Look! On the mountains are the feet of one bringing good news,The one proclaiming peace.+ Celebrate your festivals,+ O Judah, pay your vows,For the worthless one will never pass through you again. He will be utterly destroyed.”
