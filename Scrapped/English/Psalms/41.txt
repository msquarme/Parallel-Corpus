41  Happy is anyone who shows consideration to the lowly one;+Jehovah will rescue him in the day of calamity. 
 2  Jehovah will guard him and keep him alive. He will be pronounced happy in the earth;+You will never turn him over to the will* of his enemies.+ 
 3  Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed;+During his sickness you will completely change his bed. 
 4  For I said: “O Jehovah, show me favor.+ Heal me,*+ for I have sinned against you.”+ 
 5  But my enemies speak evil about me: “When will he die and his name perish?” 
 6  If one of them comes to see me, his heart speaks falsely. He gathers something harmful to say;Then he goes out and spreads it abroad. 
 7  All those who hate me whisper to one another;They are scheming something bad against me: 
 8  “A dreadful thing has overtaken him;Now that he is down, he will not rise again.”+ 
 9  Even the man at peace with me, one whom I trusted,+Who was eating my bread, has lifted his heel against me.*+ 
10  But you, O Jehovah, show me favor and raise me up,So that I may repay them. 
11  By this I will know that you are pleased with me: When my enemy cannot shout in triumph over me.+ 
12  As for me, you uphold me because of my integrity;+You will keep me in your presence forever.+ 
13  May Jehovah, the God of Israel, be praisedThroughout all eternity.*+ Amen and Amen.
