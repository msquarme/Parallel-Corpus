18  I have affection for you, O Jehovah, my strength.+ 
 2  Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the One who rescues me.+ My God is my rock,+ in whom I take refuge,My shield and my horn* of salvation,* my secure refuge.*+ 
 3  I call on Jehovah, who is worthy of praise,And I will be saved from my enemies.+ 
 4  The ropes of death encircled me;+Flash floods of worthless men terrified me.+ 
 5  The ropes of the Grave* surrounded me;The snares of death confronted me.+ 
 6  In my distress I called on Jehovah,To my God I kept crying for help. From his temple he heard my voice,+And my cry to him for help reached his ears.+ 
 7  Then the earth began to shake and rock;+The foundations of the mountains trembledAnd shook back and forth because he had been angered.+ 
 8  Smoke ascended from his nostrils,And a consuming fire came from his mouth;+Glowing coals blazed from him. 
 9  He made the heavens bend as he descended,+And thick gloom was beneath his feet.+ 
10  He rode on a cherub and came flying.+ He swooped down on the wings of a spirit.*+ 
11  He then covered himself in darkness,+All around him as a shelter,Dark waters and thick clouds.+ 
12  From the brightness before himHail and fiery coals broke through the clouds. 
13  Then Jehovah began to thunder in the heavens;+The Most High made his voice heard+With hailstones and fiery coals. 
14  He shot his arrows and scattered them;+He hurled his lightning and threw them into confusion.+ 
15  The streambeds* became visible;+The foundations of the land were exposed by your rebuke, O Jehovah,By the blast of the breath from your nostrils.+ 
16  He reached down from on high;He took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters.+ 
17  He rescued me from my strong enemy,+From those hating me, who were stronger than I was.+ 
18  They confronted me on the day of my disaster,+But Jehovah was my support. 
19  He brought me out into a place of safety;*He rescued me because he was pleased with me.+ 
20  Jehovah rewards me according to my righteousness;+He repays me according to the innocence* of my hands.+ 
21  For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,And I have not wickedly abandoned my God. 
22  All his judgments are before me;I will not disregard his statutes. 
23  I will remain blameless before him,+And I will keep myself from error.+ 
24  May Jehovah repay me according to my righteousness,+According to the innocence of my hands before him.+ 
25  With someone loyal you act in loyalty;+With the blameless man you deal blamelessly;+
26  With the pure you show yourself pure,+But with the crooked you show yourself shrewd.+ 
27  For you save those who are lowly*+But you abase the haughty.*+ 
28  For it is you who light my lamp, O Jehovah,My God who lights up my darkness.+ 
29  With your help I can charge against a marauder band;+By God’s power I can scale a wall.+ 
30  The way of the true God is perfect;+The saying of Jehovah is refined.+ He is a shield to all those taking refuge in him.+ 
31  For who is a God besides Jehovah?+ And who is a rock except our God?+ 
32  The true God is the one who clothes me with strength,+And he will make my way perfect.+ 
33  He makes my feet like those of a deer;He makes me stand on high places.+ 
34  He trains my hands for warfare;My arms can bend a bow of copper. 
35  You give me your shield of salvation,+Your right hand supports* me,And your humility makes me great.+ 
36  You widen the path for my footsteps;My feet* will not slip.+ 
37  I will pursue my enemies and overtake them;I will not return until they are wiped out. 
38  I will crush them so that they cannot rise up;+They will fall under my feet. 
39  You will equip me with strength for the battle;You will make my foes collapse under me.+ 
40  You will make my enemies retreat from me,*And I will put an end to* those who hate me.+ 
41  They cry for help, but there is no one to save them;They even cry to Jehovah, but he does not answer them. 
42  I will pound them as fine as dust in the wind;I will throw them out like mud in the streets. 
43  You will rescue me from the faultfinding of the people.+ You will appoint me the head of nations.+ A people whom I have not known will serve me.+ 
44  At a mere report they will obey me;Foreigners will come cringing before me.+ 
45  Foreigners will lose courage;*They will come trembling from their strongholds. 
46  Jehovah is alive! Praised be my Rock!+ Let the God of my salvation be exalted.+ 
47  The true God executes vengeance for me;+He subdues the peoples under me. 
48  He rescues me from my angry enemies;You lift me high above those who attack me;+You save me from the man of violence. 
49  That is why I will glorify you among the nations, O Jehovah,+And to your name I will sing praises.*+ 
50  He performs great acts of salvation* for his king;+He displays loyal love to his anointed one,+To David and his offspring* forever.+
