83  O God, do not be silent;+Do not keep quiet* or still, O Divine One. 
 2  For look! your enemies are in an uproar;+Those who hate you act arrogantly.* 
 3  With cunning they secretly plot against your people;They conspire against your treasured ones.* 
 4  They say: “Come, let us annihilate them as a nation,+So that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.” 
 5  They devise a unified strategy;*They have made an alliance* against you+—
 6  The tents of Eʹdom and the Ishʹma·el·ites, Moʹab+ and the Hagʹrites,+
 7  Geʹbal and Amʹmon+ and Amʹa·lek,Phi·lisʹti·a+ together with the inhabitants of Tyre.+ 
 8  As·syrʹi·a+ too has joined them;They give support to* the sons of Lot.+ (Selah) 
 9  Do to them as you did to Midʹi·an,+As you did to Sisʹe·ra and Jaʹbin at the stream* of Kiʹshon.+ 
10  They were annihilated at En-dor;+They became manure for the ground. 
11  Make their nobles like Oʹreb and Zeʹeb+And their princes* like Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna,+
12  For they said: “Let us take possession of the land where God dwells.” 
13  O my God, make them like a whirling thistle,*+Like stubble blown about by the wind. 
14  Like a fire that burns up the forest,Like a flame that scorches the mountains,+
15  So may you pursue them with your tempest+And terrify them with your windstorm.+ 
16  Cover* their faces with dishonor,So that they may search for your name, O Jehovah. 
17  May they be put to shame and be terrified forever;May they be disgraced and perish;
18  May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah,+You alone are the Most High over all the earth.+
