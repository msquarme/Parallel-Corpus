66  Shout in triumph to God, all the earth.+ 
 2  Sing praises* to his glorious name. Make his praise glorious.+ 
 3  Say to God: “How awe-inspiring your works are!+ Because of your great power,Your enemies will cringe before you.+ 
 4  All the earth will bow down to you;+They will sing praises to you;They will sing praises to your name.”+ (Selah) 
 5  Come and see the works of God. His deeds toward the sons of men are awe-inspiring.+ 
 6  He changed the sea into dry land;+They crossed the river on foot.+ There we rejoiced in him.+ 
 7  He rules forever+ by his might. His eyes keep watch on the nations.+ Those who are stubborn should not exalt themselves.+ (Selah) 
 8  Praise our God, you peoples,+And let the sound of his praise be heard. 
 9  He preserves us alive;*+He does not allow our feet to stumble.*+ 
10  For you have examined us, O God;+As silver is refined, so you have refined us. 
11  You brought us into a hunting net;You put a crushing burden upon us.* 
12  You allowed mortal man to ride over us;*We came through fire and through water;Then you brought us to a place of relief. 
13  I will come into your house with whole burnt offerings;+I will pay my vows to you+
14  That my lips promised+And my mouth spoke when I was in distress. 
15  I will offer burnt offerings of fattened animals to youWith the smoke of sacrificial rams. I will offer bulls along with male goats. (Selah) 
16  Come and listen, all you who fear God,And I will tell you what he has done for me.*+ 
17  I called to him with my mouthAnd glorified him with my tongue. 
18  If I had harbored anything hurtful in my heart,Jehovah would not have heard me.+ 
19  But God did hear;+He paid attention to my prayer.+ 
20  Praise to God, who did not reject my prayerOr withhold his loyal love from me.
