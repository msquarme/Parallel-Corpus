52  Why do you boast about your evil acts, you mighty one?+ The loyal love of God lasts all day long.+ 
 2  Your tongue, as sharp as a razor,+Schemes harm and works deceitfully.+ 
 3  You love evil more than what is good,Lying more than speaking what is right. (Selah) 
 4  You love every harmful word,O you deceitful tongue! 
 5  That is why God will pull you down once and for all;+He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent;+He will uproot you from the land of the living.+ (Selah) 
 6  The righteous ones will see it and be filled with awe,+And they will laugh at him.+ 
 7  “Here is a man who did not make God his refuge,*+But he trusted in his great riches+And relied on* his own evil plots.”* 
 8  But I will be like a luxuriant olive tree in God’s house;My trust is in God’s loyal love,+ forever and ever. 
 9  I will praise you forever because you have taken action;+In the presence of your loyal ones,I will hope in your name,+ for it is good.
