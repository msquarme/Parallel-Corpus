76  God is known in Judah;+In Israel his name is great.+ 
 2  His shelter is in Saʹlem,+And his dwelling is in Zion.+ 
 3  There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow,The shield and the sword and the weapons of war.+ (Selah) 
 4  You shine brightly;*You are more majestic than the mountains of prey. 
 5  The courageous of heart have been plundered.+ They have fallen asleep;The warriors were all helpless.+ 
 6  From your rebuke, O God of Jacob,Both the charioteer and the horse have fallen fast asleep.+ 
 7  You alone are awe-inspiring.+ Who can withstand your intense anger?+ 
 8  From heaven you pronounced judgment;+The earth was afraid and was silent+
 9  When God rose up to execute judgment,To save all the meek of the earth.+ (Selah) 
10  For the rage of man will serve to your praise;+With the remnants of their rage you will adorn yourself. 
11  Make your vows to Jehovah your God and pay them,+Let all who are around him bring their gift in fear.+ 
12  He will humble the pride* of leaders;He inspires fear in the kings of the earth.
