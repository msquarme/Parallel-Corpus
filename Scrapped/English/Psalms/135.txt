135  Praise Jah!* Praise the name of Jehovah;Offer praise, you servants of Jehovah,+
 2  You who are standing in the house of Jehovah,In the courtyards of the house of our God.+ 
 3  Praise Jah, for Jehovah is good.+ Sing praises* to his name, for it is pleasant. 
 4  For Jah has chosen Jacob for himself,Israel for his special property.*+ 
 5  For I well know that Jehovah is great;Our Lord is greater than all other gods.+ 
 6  Jehovah does everything he pleases to do+In heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the depths. 
 7  He causes clouds* to ascend from the ends of the earth;He makes lightning for* the rain;He brings the wind out of his storehouses.+ 
 8  He struck down the firstborn of Egypt,Both man and beast.+ 
 9  He sent signs and miracles among you, O Egypt,+Against Pharʹaoh and all his servants.+ 
10  He struck down many nations+And killed mighty kings+
11  —Siʹhon the king of the Amʹor·ites,+Og the king of Baʹshan,+And all the kingdoms of Caʹnaan. 
12  He gave their land as an inheritance,An inheritance to Israel his people.+ 
13  O Jehovah, your name endures forever. O Jehovah, your fame* endures for all generations.+ 
14  For Jehovah will defend* his people,+And he will feel compassion* for his servants.+ 
15  The idols of the nations are silver and gold,The work of human hands.+ 
16  A mouth they have, but they cannot speak;+Eyes, but they cannot see;
17  Ears they have, but they cannot hear. There is no breath in their mouth.+ 
18  The people who make them will become just like them,+As will all those who trust in them.+ 
19  O house of Israel, praise Jehovah. O house of Aaron, praise Jehovah. 
20  O house of Leʹvi, praise Jehovah.+ You who fear Jehovah, praise Jehovah. 
21  May Jehovah be praised from Zion,+The One residing in Jerusalem.+ Praise Jah!+
