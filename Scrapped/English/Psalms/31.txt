31  In you, O Jehovah, I have taken refuge.+ May I never be put to shame.+ Rescue me because of your righteousness.+ 
 2  Incline your ear* to me. Come quickly to my rescue.+ Become for me a mountain stronghold,A fortified place to save me.+ 
 3  For you are my crag and my stronghold;+For the sake of your name,+ you will lead me and guide me.+ 
 4  You will free me from the net that they have secretly laid for me,+For you are my fortress.+ 
 5  Into your hand I entrust my spirit.+ You have redeemed me, O Jehovah, the God of truth.*+ 
 6  I hate those who are devoted to worthless, vain idols,But as for me, I trust in Jehovah. 
 7  I will rejoice greatly in your loyal love,For you have seen my affliction;+You are aware of my deep distress.* 
 8  You have not handed me over to the enemy,But you make me stand in a place of safety.* 
 9  Show me favor, O Jehovah, for I am in distress. Anguish has made my eyes weak,+ my whole body* as well.+ 
10  My life is consumed with grief+And my years with groaning.+ My strength is waning because of my error;My bones grow weak.+ 
11  I am scorned by all my adversaries,+Especially my neighbors. And I am dreaded by my acquaintances;When they see me in public, they flee from me.+ 
12  I am put out of their heart* and forgotten, as if I were dead;I am like a broken jar. 
13  I have heard many evil rumors;Terror surrounds me.+ When they gather together as one against me,They scheme to take away my life.*+ 
14  But I trust in you, O Jehovah.+ I declare: “You are my God.”+ 
15  My days* are in your hand. Rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from those persecuting me.+ 
16  Make your face shine upon your servant.+ Save me by your loyal love. 
17  O Jehovah, may I not be put to shame when I call on you.+ May the wicked be put to shame;+May they be silenced in the Grave.*+ 
18  May lying lips become speechless,+Lips that speak arrogantly against the righteous, with haughtiness and contempt. 
19  How abundant your goodness is!+ You have stored it up for those who fear you,+And you have shown it before all men, in behalf of those taking refuge in you.+ 
20  You will conceal them in the secret place of your presence+From the schemes of men;You will hide them in your shelterFrom malicious attacks.*+ 
21  May Jehovah be praised,For in a wonderful way, he has shown his loyal love to me+ in a besieged city.+ 
22  As for me, I panicked and said: “I will perish from before you.”+ But you heard my pleas for help when I cried out to you.+ 
23  Love Jehovah, all you who are loyal to him!+ Jehovah protects the faithful,+But he repays exceedingly anyone showing haughtiness.+ 
24  Be courageous, and may your heart be strong,+All you who are waiting for Jehovah.+
