106  Praise Jah!* Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good;+His loyal love endures forever.+ 
 2  Who can fully declare Jehovah’s mighty actsOr proclaim all his praiseworthy deeds?+ 
 3  Happy are those who act with justice,Who always do what is right.+ 
 4  Remember me, O Jehovah, when you show favor* toward your people.+ Take care of me with your acts of salvation,
 5  So that I may enjoy the goodness you show your chosen ones,+That I may rejoice along with your nation,That I may proudly praise* you along with your inheritance. 
 6  We have sinned just as our forefathers did;+We have done wrong; we have acted wickedly.+ 
 7  Our forefathers in Egypt did not appreciate* your wonderful works. They did not remember your abundant loyal love,But they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea.+ 
 8  But he saved them for the sake of his name,+To make his mightiness known.+ 
 9  He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up;He led them through its depths as through a desert;*+
10  He saved them from the hand of their foe+And reclaimed them from the hand of the enemy.+ 
11  The waters covered their adversaries;Not one of them survived.*+ 
12  Then they had faith in his promise;+They began to sing his praise.+ 
13  But they quickly forgot what he did;+They did not wait for his counsel. 
14  They gave way to their selfish desires in the wilderness;+They tested God in the desert.+ 
15  He gave them what they requested,But then struck them with disease that made them* waste away.+ 
16  In the camp they grew jealous of MosesAnd of Aaron,+ the holy one of Jehovah.+ 
17  The earth then opened up and swallowed DaʹthanAnd covered those assembled with A·biʹram.+ 
18  A fire blazed among their group;A flame consumed the wicked.+ 
19  They made a calf in HoʹrebAnd bowed down to a statue of metal;*+
20  They exchanged my gloryFor the representation of a grass-eating bull.+ 
21  They forgot God+ their Savior,Who did great things in Egypt,+
22  Wonderful works in the land of Ham,+Awe-inspiring deeds at the Red Sea.+ 
23  He was about to order their annihilation,But Moses his chosen one interceded with him*To avert his destructive anger.+ 
24  Then they despised the desirable land;+They had no faith in his promise.+ 
25  They kept grumbling in their tents;+They did not listen to the voice of Jehovah.+ 
26  So he raised his hand in an oath concerning themThat he would make them fall in the wilderness;+
27  He would make their descendants fall among the nations,And he would scatter them throughout the lands.+ 
28  Then they joined in worship of* Baʹal of Peʹor,+And they ate sacrifices offered to the dead.* 
29  They provoked Him by their actions,+And a scourge broke out among them.+ 
30  But when Phinʹe·has stood up and intervened,The scourge was halted.+ 
31  And it was counted to him as righteousnessThrough all generations forever.+ 
32  They provoked Him at the waters of Merʹi·bah,*And it went badly for Moses because of them.+ 
33  They embittered his spirit,And he spoke rashly with his lips.+ 
34  They did not annihilate the peoples,+As Jehovah had commanded them.+ 
35  But they mingled with the nations+And adopted* their ways.+ 
36  They kept serving their idols,+And these became a snare to them.+ 
37  They would sacrifice their sonsAnd their daughters to demons.+ 
38  They kept spilling innocent blood,+The blood of their own sons and daughtersWhom they sacrificed to the idols of Caʹnaan;+And the land was polluted with bloodshed. 
39  They became unclean by their works;They committed spiritual prostitution by their deeds.+ 
40  So the anger of Jehovah blazed against his people,And he grew to detest his inheritance. 
41  He repeatedly handed them over to the nations,+So that those who hated them might rule over them.+ 
42  Their enemies oppressed them,And they were subject to their power.* 
43  Many times he rescued them,+But they would rebel and disobey,+And they would be brought low for their error.+ 
44  But he would see their distress+And hear their cry for help.+ 
45  For their sake he would remember his covenant,And he would feel pity,* moved by his great* loyal love.+ 
46  He would cause them to be pitiedBy all who held them captive.+ 
47  Save us, O Jehovah our God,+And gather us from the nations+So that we may give thanks to your holy nameAnd exult in praising you.*+ 
48  May Jehovah, the God of Israel, be praisedThroughout all eternity.*+ And let all the people say, “Amen!”* Praise Jah!*
