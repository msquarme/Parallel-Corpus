102  O Jehovah, hear my prayer;+Let my cry for help reach you.+ 
 2  Do not hide your face from me in my time of distress.+ Incline your ear* to me;Do answer me quickly when I call.+ 
 3  For my days are vanishing like smoke,And my bones are charred like a fireplace.+ 
 4  My heart has been struck down like grass and has withered,+For I forget to eat my food. 
 5  Because of my loud groaning,+My bones cling to my flesh.+ 
 6  I resemble the pelican of the wilderness;I am like a little owl among the ruins. 
 7  I lie awake;*I am like a solitary bird on a roof.+ 
 8  All day long my enemies taunt me.+ Those who mock me* use my name as a curse. 
 9  For I eat ashes as my bread,+And my drink is mingled with tears,+
10  Because of your anger and your indignation,For you lifted me up only to cast me aside. 
11  My days are like a fading shadow,*+And I am withering like grass.+ 
12  But you remain forever, O Jehovah,+And your fame* will endure for all generations.+ 
13  Surely you will rise up and show mercy on Zion,+For it is time to show her your favor;+The appointed time has come.+ 
14  For your servants find pleasure in her stones+And have affection even for her dust.+ 
15  The nations will fear the name of Jehovah,And all the kings of the earth your glory.+ 
16  For Jehovah will rebuild Zion;+He will appear in his glory.+ 
17  He will pay attention to the prayer of the destitute;+He will not despise their prayer.+ 
18  This is written for the future generation,+So that a people yet to be brought forth* will praise Jah. 
19  For he looks down from his holy height,+From the heavens Jehovah views the earth,
20  To hear the sighing of the prisoner,+To release those sentenced to death,+
21  So that the name of Jehovah will be declared in Zion+And his praise in Jerusalem,
22  When the peoples and kingdomsGather together to serve Jehovah.+ 
23  He prematurely robbed me of my strength;He cut short my days. 
24  I said: “O my God,Do not do away with me in the middle of my life,You whose years span all generations.+ 
25  Long ago you laid the foundations of the earth,And the heavens are the work of your hands.+ 
26  They will perish, but you will remain;Just like a garment they will all wear out. Just like clothing you will replace them, and they will pass away. 
27  But you are the same, and your years will never end.+ 
28  The children of your servants will dwell securely,And their offspring will be firmly established before you.”+
