108  My heart is steadfast, O God. I will sing and make music with my whole being.*+ 
 2  Do awake, O stringed instrument; you too, O harp.+ I will awaken the dawn. 
 3  I will praise you among the peoples, O Jehovah,And I will sing praises* to you among the nations. 
 4  For your loyal love is great, as high as the heavens,+And your faithfulness, up to the skies. 
 5  Be exalted above the heavens, O God;May your glory be over all the earth.+ 
 6  So that your loved ones may be rescued,Save us with your right hand and answer me.+ 
 7  God has spoken in his holiness:* “I will exult, I will give out Sheʹchem+ as an inheritance,And I will measure off the Valley* of Sucʹcoth.+ 
 8  Gilʹe·ad+ belongs to me, as does Ma·nasʹseh,And Eʹphra·im is the helmet* for my head;+Judah is my commander’s staff.+ 
 9  Moʹab is my washbasin.+ Over Eʹdom I will throw my sandal.+ Over Phi·lisʹti·a I will shout in triumph.”+ 
10  Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me as far as Eʹdom?+ 
11  Is it not you, O God, who have rejected us,Our God, who no longer goes out with our armies?+ 
12  Help us in our distress,+For salvation by humans is worthless.+ 
13  By God we will gain power,+And he will trample on our adversaries.+
