90  O Jehovah, you have been our dwelling place*+ throughout all generations. 
 2  Before the mountains were bornOr you brought forth* the earth and the productive land,+From everlasting to everlasting,* you are God.+ 
 3  You make mortal man return to dust;You say: “Return, you sons of men.”+ 
 4  For a thousand years are in your eyes just as yesterday when it is past,+Just as a watch during the night. 
 5  You sweep them away;+ they become like mere sleep;In the morning they are like grass that sprouts.+ 
 6  In the morning it blossoms and is renewed,But by evening it withers and dries up.+ 
 7  For we are consumed by your anger+And terrified by your rage. 
 8  You place our errors in front of you;*+Our secrets are exposed by the light of your face.+ 
 9  Our days ebb* away because of your fury;And our years come to an end like a whisper.* 
10  The span of our life is 70 years,Or 80+ if one is especially strong.* But they are filled with trouble and sorrow;They quickly pass by, and away we fly.+ 
11  Who can fathom the power of your anger? Your fury is as great as the fear you deserve.+ 
12  Teach us how to count our days+So that we may acquire a heart of wisdom. 
13  Return, O Jehovah!+ How long will this last?+ Have pity on your servants.+ 
14  Satisfy us with your loyal love+ in the morning,So that we may shout joyfully and rejoice+ during all our days. 
15  Make us rejoice in proportion to the days you have afflicted us,+For as many years as we have experienced calamity.+ 
16  May your servants see your activity,And may their sons see your splendor.+ 
17  May the favor of Jehovah our God be upon us;May you prosper* the work of our hands. Yes, prosper* the work of our hands.+
