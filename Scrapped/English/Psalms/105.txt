105  Give thanks to Jehovah,+ call on his name,Make his deeds known among the peoples!+ 
 2  Sing to him, sing praises* to him,Ponder over* all his wonderful works.+ 
 3  Boast about his holy name.+ Let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.+ 
 4  Search for Jehovah+ and his strength. Seek his face* constantly. 
 5  Remember the wonderful works he has performed,His miracles and the judgments he has pronounced,+
 6  You offspring* of Abraham his servant,+You sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.+ 
 7  He is Jehovah our God.+ His judgments are throughout the earth.+ 
 8  He remembers his covenant forever,+The promise he made,* to a thousand generations,+
 9  The covenant he made with Abraham,+And the oath he swore to Isaac,+
10  Which he established as a decree to JacobAnd as a lasting covenant to Israel,
11  Saying, “I will give you the land of Caʹnaan+As your allotted inheritance.”+ 
12  This was when they were few in number,+Yes, very few, and they were foreigners in the land.+ 
13  They walked about from nation to nation,From one kingdom to another people.+ 
14  He did not allow any man to oppress them,+But on their account he reproved kings,+
15  Saying, “Do not touch my anointed ones,And to my prophets do nothing bad.”+ 
16  He called down a famine on the land;+He cut off their supply of bread.* 
17  He sent ahead of them a manWho was sold to be a slave, Joseph.+ 
18  With fetters they bound* his feet,+His neck was put in irons;*
19  Until the time that his word proved true,+The saying of Jehovah is what refined him. 
20  The king sent to release him,+The ruler of the peoples set him free. 
21  He made him master of his household,Ruler over all his property,+
22  To have authority over* his princes as he pleased*And to teach his elders wisdom.+ 
23  Then Israel came into Egypt,+And Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham. 
24  God made his people very fruitful;+He made them mightier than their adversaries,+
25  Whose hearts he let change to hate his people,To plot against his servants.+ 
26  He sent his servant Moses,+And Aaron,+ whom he had chosen. 
27  They performed his signs among them,His miracles in the land of Ham.+ 
28  He sent darkness and the land became dark;+They did not rebel against his words. 
29  He changed their waters into bloodAnd killed their fish.+ 
30  Their land swarmed with frogs,+Even in the royal chambers. 
31  He ordered the gadflies to invadeAnd gnats in all their territories.+ 
32  He turned their rain to hailAnd sent lightning* on their land.+ 
33  He struck their vines and their fig treesAnd shattered the trees of their territory. 
34  He said that the locusts should invade,Young locusts without number.+ 
35  They devoured all the vegetation in the land,And they devoured the produce of the ground. 
36  Then he struck down every firstborn in their land,+The beginning of their procreative power. 
37  He brought his people out with silver and gold;+And no one among his tribes stumbled. 
38  Egypt rejoiced when they left,For the dread of Israel* had fallen on them.+ 
39  He spread a cloud to screen them off+ And fire to give light by night.+ 
40  They asked, and he brought quail;+He kept satisfying them with bread from heaven.+ 
41  He opened a rock, and waters flowed out;+These flowed through the desert like a river.+ 
42  For he remembered the holy promise he had made to Abraham his servant.+ 
43  So he brought out his people with exultation,+His chosen ones with a joyful cry. 
44  He gave them the lands of nations;+They inherited what other peoples had worked hard to produce,+
45  So that they would keep his decrees+And observe his laws. Praise Jah!*
