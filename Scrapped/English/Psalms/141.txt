141  O Jehovah, I call on you.+ Come quickly to help me.+ Do pay attention when I call to you.+ 
 2  May my prayer be as incense+ prepared before you,+My uplifted hands like the evening grain offering.+ 
 3  Station a guard for my mouth, O Jehovah,Do set a watch over the door of my lips.+ 
 4  Do not let my heart incline to anything bad,+To share in vile deeds with evil men;May I never feast on their delicacies. 
 5  Should the righteous one strike me, it would be an act of loyal love;+Should he reprove me, it would be like oil on my head,+Which my head would never refuse.+ My prayer will continue even during their calamities. 
 6  Though their judges are thrown down from the cliff,The people will pay attention to my words, for they are pleasant. 
 7  Just as when someone plows and breaks up the soil,So our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the Grave.* 
 8  But my eyes look to you, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah.+ In you I have taken refuge. Do not take away my life.* 
 9  Protect me from the jaws of the trap they have laid for me,From the snares of evildoers. 
10  The wicked will fall into their own nets all together+While I pass by safely.
