55  Listen to my prayer, O God,+And do not ignore my request for mercy.*+ 
 2  Do pay attention to me and answer me.+ My concern makes me restless,+And I am distraught
 3  Because of what the enemy is sayingAnd the pressure from the wicked one. For they heap trouble upon me,And in anger they harbor animosity against me.+ 
 4  My heart is in anguish within me,+And the terrors of death overwhelm me.+ 
 5  Fear and trembling come upon me,And shuddering grips me. 
 6  I keep saying: “If only I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and reside in safety. 
 7  Look! I would flee far away.+ I would lodge in the wilderness.+ (Selah) 
 8  I would hurry to a place of shelterAway from the raging wind, away from the storm.” 
 9  Confuse them, O Jehovah, and frustrate their plans,*+For I have seen violence and conflict in the city. 
10  Day and night they walk around on its walls;Within it are malice and trouble.+ 
11  Ruin is in its midst;Oppression and deception never depart from its public square.+ 
12  For it is not an enemy who taunts me;+Otherwise I could put up with it. It is not a foe who has risen up against me;Otherwise I could conceal myself from him. 
13  But it is you, a man like me,*+My own companion whom I know well.+ 
14  We used to enjoy a warm friendship together;Into the house of God we used to walk along with the multitude. 
15  May destruction overtake them!+ Let them go down alive into the Grave;*For evil resides among them and within them. 
16  As for me, I will call out to God,And Jehovah will save me.+ 
17  Evening and morning and noontime, I am troubled and I groan,*+And he hears my voice.+ 
18  He will rescue* me and give me* peace from those fighting against me,For multitudes come against me.+ 
19  God will hear and respond to them,+The one who sits enthroned from of old.+ (Selah) They will refuse to change,Those who have not feared God.+ 
20  He* attacked those at peace with him;+He violated his covenant.+ 
21  His words are smoother than butter,+But conflict is in his heart. His words are softer than oil,But they are drawn swords.+ 
22  Throw your burden on Jehovah,+And he will sustain you.+ Never will he allow the righteous one to fall.*+ 
23  But you, O God, will bring them down to the deepest pit.+ Those bloodguilty and deceitful men will not live out half their days.+ But as for me, I will trust in you.
