59  Rescue me from my enemies, O my God;+Protect me from those rising up against me.+ 
 2  Rescue me from those who act wickedly,And save me from violent* men. 
 3  Look! They wait to ambush me;*+Strong men attack meBut not because I have revolted or sinned,+ O Jehovah. 
 4  Though I did no wrong, they run and prepare to attack. Do arise at my calling and see. 
 5  For you, O Jehovah God of armies, are the God of Israel.+ Awake to turn your attention to all the nations. Do not show mercy to any malicious traitors.+ (Selah) 
 6  They return each evening;+They growl* like dogs+ and prowl around the city.+ 
 7  Look what pours* forth from their mouth;Their lips are like swords,+For they say: “Who is listening?”+ 
 8  But you, O Jehovah, will laugh at them;+You will scoff at all the nations.+ 
 9  O my Strength, I will keep watch for you;+For God is my secure refuge.*+ 
10  The God who shows loyal love to me will come to my aid;+God will cause me to look in triumph on my foes.+ 
11  Do not kill them, so that my people may not forget. By your power make them wander about;Cause their downfall, O Jehovah, our shield.+ 
12  For the sin of their mouth, the word of their lips,May they be trapped by their pride,+Because of the cursing and deception that they speak. 
13  Finish them off in your wrath;+Finish them off, so that they are no more;Make them know that God is ruling in Jacob and to the ends of the earth.+ (Selah) 
14  Let them return in the evening;Let them growl* like dogs and prowl around the city.+ 
15  Let them wander about for something to eat;+Do not let them be satisfied or find a lodging place. 
16  But as for me, I will sing about your strength;+In the morning I will joyfully tell about your loyal love. For you are my secure refuge+And a place for me to flee in my time of distress.+ 
17  O my Strength, to you I will sing praises,*+For God is my secure refuge, the God who shows loyal love to me.+
