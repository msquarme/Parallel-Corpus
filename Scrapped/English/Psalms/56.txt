56  Show me favor, O God, because mortal man is attacking* me. All day long they keep fighting and oppressing me. 
 2  My foes keep snapping at me all day long;Many arrogantly fight against me. 
 3  When I am afraid,+ I put my trust in you.+ 
 4  In God—whose word I praise—In God I put my trust; I am not afraid. What can mere man* do to me?+ 
 5  All day long they hurt my interests;Their only thought is to harm me.+ 
 6  They conceal themselves to attack;They watch my every step,+Hoping to take away my life.*+ 
 7  Reject them because of their wickedness. Bring down the nations in your anger, O God.+ 
 8  You keep track of my wandering.+ Do collect my tears in your skin bottle.+ Are they not recorded in your book?+ 
 9  My enemies will retreat on the day that I call for help.+ Of this I am confident: God is on my side.+ 
10  In God—whose word I praise—In Jehovah—whose word I praise—
11  In God I put my trust; I am not afraid.+ What can a mere human do to me?+ 
12  I am bound by my vows to you, O God;+I will offer you expressions of thanksgiving.+ 
13  For you have rescued me* from death+And prevented my feet from stumbling,+So that I may walk before God in the light of the living.+
