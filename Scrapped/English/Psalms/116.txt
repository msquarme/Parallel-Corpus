116  I love JehovahBecause he hears* my voice, my pleas for help.+ 
 2  For he inclines his ear* to me,+And I will call on him as long as I live.* 
 3  The ropes of death encircled me;The Grave had me in its grip.*+ I was overcome by distress and grief.+ 
 4  But I called on the name of Jehovah:+ “O Jehovah, rescue me!”* 
 5  Jehovah is compassionate* and righteous;+Our God is merciful.+ 
 6  Jehovah is guarding the inexperienced.+ I was brought low, and he saved me. 
 7  Let my soul* rest once again,For Jehovah has dealt kindly with me. 
 8  You have rescued me* from death,My eye from tears, my foot from stumbling.+ 
 9  I will walk before Jehovah in the land of the living. 
10  I had faith, for I spoke;+I was greatly afflicted. 
11  As for me, I panicked and said: “Every man is a liar.”+ 
12  With what will I repay JehovahFor all the good he has done for me? 
13  I will take up the cup of salvation,*And I will call on the name of Jehovah. 
14  I will pay my vows to JehovahIn the presence of all his people.+ 
15  Costly* in the eyes of JehovahIs the death of his loyal ones.+ 
16  I beg you, O Jehovah,For I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your slave girl. You have freed me from my bonds.+ 
17  I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving;+I will call on the name of Jehovah. 
18  I will pay my vows to Jehovah+In the presence of all his people,+
19  In the courtyards of the house of Jehovah,+In your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise Jah!*+
