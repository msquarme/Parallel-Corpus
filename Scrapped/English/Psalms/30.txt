30  I will exalt you, O Jehovah, for you have lifted* me up;You did not let my enemies rejoice over me.+ 
 2  O Jehovah my God, I cried to you for help, and you healed me.+ 
 3  O Jehovah, you have lifted me* up from the Grave.*+ You kept me alive; you spared me from sinking into the pit.*+ 
 4  Sing praises* to Jehovah, you his loyal ones,+Give thanks to his holy name;*+
 5  Because being under his anger is only for a moment,+But being in his favor* is for a lifetime.+ Weeping may come in the evening, but in the morning, there is a joyful cry.+ 
 6  When I was untroubled, I said: “I will never be shaken.”* 
 7  O Jehovah, while I was in your favor,* you made me as strong as a mountain.+ But when you hid your face, I became terrified.+ 
 8  To you, O Jehovah, I kept calling;+And to Jehovah, I kept pleading for favor. 
 9  What profit is there in my death,* in my going down to the pit?*+ Will the dust praise you?+ Will it tell of your faithfulness?+ 
10  Hear, O Jehovah, and show me favor.+ O Jehovah, become my helper.+ 
11  You have changed my mourning into dancing;You have removed my sackcloth, and you clothe me with rejoicing,
12  So that I* may sing your praise and not keep silent. O Jehovah my God, I will praise you forever.
