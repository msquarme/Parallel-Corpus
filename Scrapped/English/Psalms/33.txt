33  Shout joyfully, you righteous ones, because of Jehovah.+ It is fitting for the upright to praise him. 
 2  Give thanks to Jehovah with the harp;Sing praises* to him with a ten-stringed instrument. 
 3  Sing to him a new song;+Play skillfully on the strings, along with shouts of joy. 
 4  For the word of Jehovah is upright,+And everything he does is trustworthy. 
 5  He loves righteousness and justice.+ The earth is filled with Jehovah’s loyal love.+ 
 6  By the word of Jehovah the heavens were made,+And by the spirit* of his mouth everything in them.* 
 7  He gathers the seawaters like a dam;+He puts the surging waters in storehouses. 
 8  Let the whole earth fear Jehovah.+ Let the inhabitants of the productive land be in awe of him. 
 9  For he spoke, and it came to be;+He commanded, and it stood firm.+ 
10  Jehovah has frustrated the schemes* of the nations;+He has thwarted the plans* of the peoples.+ 
11  But the decisions* of Jehovah will stand forever;+The thoughts of his heart are from generation to generation. 
12  Happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah,+The people he has chosen as his own possession.+ 
13  Jehovah looks down from heaven;He sees all the sons of men.+ 
14  From his place of residence,He gazes on the inhabitants of the earth. 
15  He is the one forming the hearts of all;He examines all their works.+ 
16  No king is saved by a large army;+A mighty man is not saved by his great power.+ 
17  The horse is a false hope for salvation;*+Its great strength does not ensure escape. 
18  Look! The eye of Jehovah watches over those fearing him,+Those waiting for his loyal love,
19  To rescue them* from deathAnd to keep them alive during famine.+ 
20  We are* in expectation of Jehovah. He is our helper and our shield.+ 
21  Our hearts rejoice in him,For we trust in his holy name.+ 
22  May your loyal love rest upon us, O Jehovah,+While we keep waiting for you.+
