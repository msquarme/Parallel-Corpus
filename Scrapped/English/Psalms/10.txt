10  Why, O Jehovah, do you stand at a distance? Why do you hide yourself in times of distress?+ 
 2  The wicked one arrogantly pursues the helpless one,+But he will be caught in the schemes he devises.+ 
 3  For the wicked one boasts about his selfish desires*+And blesses the greedy one;*נ [Nun]He disrespects Jehovah. 
 4  In his haughtiness, the wicked man makes no investigation;All his thoughts are: “There is no God.”+ 
 5  His ways keep prospering,+But your judgments are beyond his understanding;+He scoffs* at all his adversaries. 
 6  He says in his heart: “I will never be shaken;*For generation after generationI will never see calamity.”+ 
 7  His mouth is full of curses, lies, and threats;+Under his tongue are trouble and injury.+ 
 8  He waits in ambush near the settlements;From his hiding place he kills an innocent one.+ ע [Ayin] His eyes are watching for an unfortunate victim.+ 
 9  He waits in his hiding place like a lion in its lair.*+ He waits to seize the helpless one. He seizes the helpless one when he pulls his net shut.+ 
10  The victim is crushed and brought down;The unfortunate ones fall into his clutches.* 
11  He says in his heart: “God has forgotten.+ He has turned away his face. He never notices.”+ 
12  Rise up, O Jehovah.+ O God, lift up your hand.+ Do not forget the helpless ones.+ 
13  Why has the wicked one disrespected God? He says in his heart: “You will not hold me accountable.” 
14  But you do see trouble and distress. You look on and take matters in hand.+ To you the unfortunate victim turns;+You are the helper for the fatherless child.*+ 
15  Break the arm of the wicked and evil man,+So that when you search for his wickedness,You will find it no more. 
16  Jehovah is King forever and ever.+ The nations have perished from the earth.+ 
17  But you will hear the request of the meek, O Jehovah.+ You will make their hearts firm+ and pay close attention to them.+ 
18  You will render justice to the fatherless and to those who are crushed,+So that mortal man of the earth may no longer make them afraid.+
