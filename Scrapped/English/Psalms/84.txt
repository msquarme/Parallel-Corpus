84  How lovely* your grand tabernacle is,+O Jehovah of armies! 
 2  My whole being* yearns,Yes, I am faint with longing,For the courtyards of Jehovah.+ My heart and my flesh shout joyfully to the living God. 
 3  Even the bird finds a home thereAnd the swallow a nest for herself,Where she cares for her youngNear your grand altar, O Jehovah of armies,My King and my God! 
 4  Happy are those dwelling in your house!+ They continue to praise you.+ (Selah) 
 5  Happy are the men who find their strength in you,+Whose hearts are set on the highways. 
 6  When they pass through the Baʹca Valley,*They make it into a place of springs;And the early rain clothes it* with blessings. 
 7  They will walk on from strength to strength;+Each one appears before God in Zion. 
 8  O Jehovah God of armies, hear my prayer;Listen, O God of Jacob. (Selah) 
 9  Look, our shield+ and our God,*Look upon the face of your anointed one.+ 
10  For a day in your courtyards is better than a thousand anywhere else!+ I choose to stand at the threshold of the house of my GodRather than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
11  For Jehovah God is a sun+ and a shield;+He gives favor and glory. Jehovah will not hold back anything goodFrom those walking in integrity.+ 
12  O Jehovah of armies,Happy is the man who trusts in you.+
