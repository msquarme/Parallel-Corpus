97  Jehovah has become King!+ Let the earth be joyful.+ Let the many islands rejoice.+ 
 2  Clouds and thick gloom are all around him;+Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.+ 
 3  Fire goes before him+And consumes his adversaries on every side.+ 
 4  His lightning bolts light up the land;The earth sees it and trembles.+ 
 5  The mountains melt like wax before Jehovah,+Before the Lord of the whole earth. 
 6  The heavens proclaim his righteousness,And all the peoples see his glory.+ 
 7  Let all those serving any carved image be put to shame,+Those who boast about their worthless gods.+ Bow down to* him, all you gods.+ 
 8  Zion hears and rejoices;+The towns* of Judah are joyfulBecause of your judgments, O Jehovah.+ 
 9  For you, O Jehovah, are the Most High over all the earth;You are exalted far above all other gods.+ 
10  O you who love Jehovah, hate what is bad.+ He is guarding the lives* of his loyal ones;+He rescues them from the hand* of the wicked.+ 
11  Light has flashed up for the righteous+And rejoicing for those upright in heart. 
12  Rejoice in Jehovah, you righteous ones,And give thanks to his holy name.*
