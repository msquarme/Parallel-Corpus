62  Indeed, I wait* silently for God. My salvation comes from him.+ 
 2  Indeed, he is my rock and my salvation, my secure refuge;*+I will never be greatly shaken.+ 
 3  How long will you assault a man in order to murder him?+ All of you are as dangerous as a leaning wall, a stone wall ready to collapse.* 
 4  For they consult together to topple him from his high position;*They take pleasure in lying. With their mouth they bless, but inside they are cursing.+ (Selah) 
 5  Indeed, I wait silently* for God+Because my hope comes from him.+ 
 6  Indeed, he is my rock and my salvation, my secure refuge;I will never be shaken.+ 
 7  Upon God depends my salvation and my glory. My strong rock, my refuge, is God.+ 
 8  Trust in him at all times, O people. Pour out your hearts before him.+ God is a refuge for us.+ (Selah) 
 9  The sons of men are a mere breath,The sons of mankind are a delusion.+ When laid together on the scales, they are lighter than a mere breath.+ 
10  Do not trust in extortionOr put false hopes in robbery. If your wealth increases, do not set your heart on it.+ 
11  Once God has spoken, twice I have heard this: That strength belongs to God.+ 
12  Also loyal love is yours, O Jehovah,+For you repay each one according to his deeds.+
