127  Unless Jehovah builds the house,It is in vain that its builders work hard on it.+ Unless Jehovah guards the city,+It is in vain that the guard stays awake. 
 2  It is in vain that you rise up early,That you stay up late,That you toil for your food,Since he provides for his loved ones while giving them sleep.+ 
 3  Look! Sons* are an inheritance from Jehovah;+The fruit of the womb is a reward.+ 
 4  Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man,So are the sons of one’s youth.+ 
 5  Happy is the man who fills his quiver with them.+ They will not be put to shame,For they will speak with enemies in the city gate.
