86  Incline your ear,* O Jehovah, and answer me,For I am afflicted and poor.+ 
 2  Guard my life,* for I am loyal.+ Save your servant who is trusting in you,For you are my God.+ 
 3  Show me favor, O Jehovah,+For I call to you all day long.+ 
 4  Make your servant* rejoice,For to you, O Jehovah, I turn.* 
 5  For you, O Jehovah, are good+ and ready to forgive;+You abound in loyal love for all those who call on you.+ 
 6  Listen, O Jehovah, to my prayer;And pay attention to my pleas for help.+ 
 7  I call on you in the day of my distress,+For you will answer me.+ 
 8  There is none like you among the gods, O Jehovah,+There are no works like yours.+ 
 9  All the nations that you madeWill come and bow down before you, O Jehovah,+And they will give glory to your name.+ 
10  For you are great and do wondrous things;+You are God, you alone.+ 
11  Instruct me, O Jehovah, about your way.+ I will walk in your truth.+ Unify my heart* to fear your name.+ 
12  I praise you, O Jehovah my God, with all my heart,+And I will glorify your name forever,
13  For your loyal love toward me is great,And you have saved my life* from the depths of the Grave.*+ 
14  O God, presumptuous men rise up against me;+A band of ruthless men seek to take my life,*And they have no regard for you.*+ 
15  But you, O Jehovah, are a God merciful and compassionate,*Slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and faithfulness.*+ 
16  Turn to me and show me favor.+ Give your strength to your servant,+And save the son of your slave girl. 
17  Show me a sign* of your goodness,So that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame. For you, O Jehovah, are my helper and comforter.
