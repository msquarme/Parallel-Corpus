65  Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion;+We will pay our vows to you.+ 
 2  O Hearer of prayer, to you people of all sorts* will come.+ 
 3  My errors have overwhelmed me,+But you cover over our transgressions.+ 
 4  Happy is the one whom you choose and bring nearTo reside in your courtyards.+ We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house,+Your holy temple.*+ 
 5  You will answer us with awe-inspiring deeds+ of righteousness,O God of our salvation;You are the Confidence of all the ends of the earth+And of those distant across the sea. 
 6  You* firmly established the mountains by your power;You* are clothed with mightiness.+ 
 7  You* calm the raging seas,+The crash of their waves and the turmoil of the nations.+ 
 8  The inhabitants of remote places will be awestruck by your signs;+You will cause those from the sunrise to the sunset to shout joyfully. 
 9  You care for the earth,Making it abundantly fruitful* and very rich.+ The stream from God is full of water;You provide grain for them,+For that is how you prepared the earth. 
10  You drench its furrows and level off its plowed soil;*You soften it with showers of rain; you bless its growth.+ 
11  You crown the year with your goodness;Your tracks overflow with abundance.*+ 
12  The pastures of the wilderness keep overflowing,*+And the hills are clothed with joyfulness.+ 
13  The pastures are covered with flocks,And the valleys* are carpeted with grain.+ They shout in triumph, yes, they sing.+
