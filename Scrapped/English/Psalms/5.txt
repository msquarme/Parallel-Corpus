5  Listen to my words, O Jehovah;+Be attentive to my sighing. 
 2  Pay attention to my cry for help,O my King and my God, because to you I pray. 
 3  O Jehovah, you will hear my voice in the morning;+In the morning I will express my concern to you+ and wait expectantly. 
 4  For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness;+No one bad may remain with you.+ 
 5  No arrogant person may stand in your presence. You hate all those who behave wickedly;+
 6  You will destroy those who speak lies.+ Jehovah detests violent and deceptive people.*+ 
 7  But I will come into your house+ because of your great loyal love;+I will bow down toward your holy temple* in reverential fear of you.+ 
 8  Lead me, O Jehovah, in your righteousness because of my foes;Make your way clear for me.+ 
 9  For nothing they say can be trusted;Within them is nothing but malice;Their throat is an open grave;They flatter with their tongue.*+ 
10  But God will declare them guilty;Their own schemes will cause their downfall.+ May they be driven away because of their many transgressions,For they have rebelled against you. 
11  But all those who take refuge in you will rejoice;+They will always shout joyfully. You will block approach to them,And those loving your name will rejoice in you. 
12  For you will bless anyone righteous, O Jehovah;You will surround them with approval as with a large shield.+
