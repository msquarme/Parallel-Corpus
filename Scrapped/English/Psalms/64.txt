64  Hear my voice, O God, as I plead.+ Safeguard my life from the dreadfulness of the enemy. 
 2  Shield me from the secret plots of wicked men,+From the crowd of wrongdoers. 
 3  They sharpen their tongue just like a sword;They aim their cruel words like arrows,
 4  To shoot at the innocent from their hiding places;They shoot at him suddenly, without fear. 
 5  They hold fast to their evil intent;*They discuss how to hide their traps. They say: “Who will see them?”+ 
 6  They search out new ways of wrongdoing;They secretly devise their shrewd strategy;+The thinking within each one’s heart is unfathomable. 
 7  But God will shoot at them;+Suddenly they will be wounded by an arrow. 
 8  Their own tongue will cause their downfall;+All those looking on will shake their head. 
 9  Then all men will become afraid,And they will proclaim what God has done,And they will have insight into his deeds.+ 
10  The righteous one will rejoice in Jehovah and take refuge in him;+All the upright in heart will exult.*
