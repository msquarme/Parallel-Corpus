80  O Shepherd of Israel, listen,You who are guiding Joseph just like a flock.+ You who sit enthroned above* the cherubs,+Shine forth.* 
 2  Before Eʹphra·im and Benjamin and Ma·nasʹseh,Do stir up your mightiness;+Come and save us.+ 
 3  O God, restore us;+Let your face shine upon us, so that we may be saved.+ 
 4  Jehovah God of armies, how long will you be hostile toward* the prayer of your people?+ 
 5  You feed them tears as their bread,And you make them drink tears beyond measure. 
 6  You let our neighbors quarrel over us;Our enemies keep mocking us as they please.+ 
 7  O God of armies, restore us;Let your face shine upon us, so that we may be saved.+ 
 8  You made a vine+ depart from Egypt. You drove out the nations and planted it.+ 
 9  You cleared a space for it,And it took root and filled the land.+ 
10  The mountains were covered by its shadow,And the cedars of God by its branches. 
11  Its branches reached as far as the sea,And its shoots to the River.*+ 
12  Why have you broken down the stone walls of the vineyard,+So that all those passing by pluck its fruit?+ 
13  The boars of the forest ravage it,And the wild animals of the field feed on it.+ 
14  O God of armies, please return. Look down from heaven and see! Take care of this vine,+
15  The stock* that your right hand has planted,+And look upon the son whom* you made strong for yourself.+ 
16  It is burned with fire,+ cut down. They perish at your rebuke.* 
17  May your hand give support to the man at your right hand,To the son of man you have made strong for yourself.+ 
18  Then we will not turn away from you. Preserve us alive, so that we may call on your name. 
19  O Jehovah God of armies, restore us;Let your face shine upon us, so that we may be saved.+
