38  O Jehovah, do not reprove me in your anger,Nor correct me in your wrath.+ 
 2  For your arrows have pierced deep into me,And your hand presses down on me.+ 
 3  My whole body is sick* because of your indignation. There is no peace within my bones because of my sin.+ 
 4  For my errors loom over my head;+Like a heavy burden, they are too much for me to bear. 
 5  My wounds stink and festerBecause of my foolishness. 
 6  I am distressed and extremely downcast;I walk around sad all day long. 
 7  There is a burning within me;*My whole body is sick.+ 
 8  I have grown numb and become completely crushed;My anguished heart makes me groan aloud.* 
 9  O Jehovah, all my desires are before you,And my sighing is not hidden from you. 
10  My heart pounds, my strength is gone,And the light of my eyes has left me.+ 
11  My friends and my companions avoid me because of my plague,And my close acquaintances keep their distance. 
12  Those seeking my life* set traps;Those trying to harm me speak of ruin;+They mutter deception all day long. 
13  But like someone deaf, I would not listen;+Like someone speechless, I would not open my mouth.+ 
14  I have become like a man who cannot hear,Whose mouth has nothing to say in defense. 
15  For on you, O Jehovah, I waited,+And you answered me, O Jehovah my God.+ 
16  For I said: “May they not gloat over meOr exalt themselves over me if my foot slips.” 
17  For I was ready to collapse,And my pain was always with me.+ 
18  I confessed my error;+I was troubled by my sin.+ 
19  But my enemies are vigorous* and mighty,*Those hating me for no reason have become numerous. 
20  They repaid me with bad for good;They were resisting me for pursuing what is good. 
21  Do not abandon me, O Jehovah. O God, do not remain far away from me.+ 
22  Do hurry to help me,O Jehovah, my salvation.+
