51  Show me favor, O God, according to your loyal love.+ Blot out my transgressions according to your great mercy.+ 
 2  Thoroughly wash me from my error,+And cleanse me from my sin.+ 
 3  For I am well-aware of my transgressions,And my sin is always before me.*+ 
 4  Against you—you above all*—I have sinned;+What is bad in your eyes I have done.+ Therefore, you are righteous when you speak,You are right in your judgment.+ 
 5  Look! I was born guilty of error,And my mother conceived me in sin.*+ 
 6  Look! You find pleasure in truth in the inner person;+Teach my innermost self* true wisdom. 
 7  Purify me from my sin with hyssop, so that I will be clean;+Wash me, so that I will be whiter than snow.+ 
 8  Let me hear sounds of joy and rejoicing,So that the bones you crushed will rejoice.+ 
 9  Turn your face away* from my sins,+And wipe away* all my errors.+ 
10  Create in me a pure heart, O God,+And put within me a new spirit,+ a steadfast one. 
11  Do not cast me out from your presence;And do not take your holy spirit away from me. 
12  Restore to me the joy of your salvation;+Stir within me a willingness to obey you.* 
13  I will teach transgressors your ways,+So that sinners will return to you. 
14  Save me from bloodguilt,+ O God, the God of my salvation,+So that my tongue may joyfully declare your righteousness.+ 
15  O Jehovah, open my lips,So that my mouth may declare your praise.+ 
16  For you do not want a sacrifice—otherwise I would give it;+You do not find delight in a whole burnt offering.+ 
17  The sacrifices pleasing to God are a broken spirit;A heart broken and crushed, O God, you will not reject.*+ 
18  In your goodwill do what is good for Zion;Build up the walls of Jerusalem. 
19  Then you will take delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,The burnt sacrifices and the whole offerings;Then bulls will be offered up on your altar.+
