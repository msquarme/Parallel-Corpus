94  O God of vengeance, Jehovah,+O God of vengeance, shine forth! 
 2  Rise up, O Judge of the earth.+ Repay to the haughty what they deserve.+ 
 3  How long will the wicked, O Jehovah,How long will the wicked continue to exult?+ 
 4  They babble and speak arrogantly;All the wrongdoers brag about themselves. 
 5  They crush your people, O Jehovah,+And oppress your inheritance. 
 6  They kill the widow and the foreign resident,And they murder the fatherless children. 
 7  They say: “Jah does not see;+The God of Jacob does not take notice of it.”+ 
 8  Understand this, you who are unreasoning;You foolish ones, when will you ever show insight?+ 
 9  The One who made* the ear, can he not hear? The One who formed the eye, can he not see?+ 
10  The One correcting the nations, can he not reprove?+ He is the One who imparts knowledge to people!+ 
11  Jehovah knows the thoughts of men,That they are but a mere breath.+ 
12  Happy is the man whom you correct, O Jah,+Whom you teach from your law,+
13  To give him tranquillity during days of calamity,Until a pit is dug for the wicked.+ 
14  For Jehovah will not forsake his people,+Nor will he abandon his inheritance.+ 
15  For judgment will once again be righteous,And all the upright in heart will follow it. 
16  Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against the wrongdoers? 
17  If Jehovah had not been my helper,I* would soon have perished.*+ 
18  When I said: “My foot is slipping,” Your loyal love, O Jehovah, kept supporting me.+ 
19  When anxieties* overwhelmed me,*You comforted and soothed me.*+ 
20  Can a throne* of corruption be allied with youWhile it is framing trouble in the name of the law?*+ 
21  They make vicious attacks on the righteous one*+And condemn the innocent one to death.*+ 
22  But Jehovah will become a secure refuge* for me,My God is my rock of refuge.+ 
23  He will make their wicked deeds come back upon them.+ He will do away with* them by means of their own evil. Jehovah our God will do away with* them.+
