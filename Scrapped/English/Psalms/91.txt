91  Anyone dwelling in the secret place of the Most High+Will lodge under the shadow of the Almighty.+ 
 2  I will say to Jehovah: “You are my refuge and my stronghold,+My God in whom I trust.”+ 
 3  For he will rescue you from the trap of the birdcatcher,From the destructive pestilence. 
 4  With his pinions he will cover* you,And under his wings you will take refuge.+ His faithfulness+ will be a large shield+ and a protective wall.* 
 5  You will not fear the terrors of the night,+Nor the arrow that flies by day,+
 6  Nor the pestilence that stalks in the gloom,Nor the destruction that ravages at midday. 
 7  A thousand will fall at your sideAnd ten thousand at your right hand,But to you it will not come near.+ 
 8  You will only see it with your eyesAs you witness the punishment* of the wicked. 
 9  Because you said: “Jehovah is my refuge,” You have made the Most High your dwelling;*+
10  No disaster will befall you,+And no plague will come near your tent. 
11  For he will give his angels+ a command concerning you,To guard you in all your ways.+ 
12  They will carry you on their hands,+So that you may not strike your foot against a stone.+ 
13  On the young lion and the cobra you will tread;You will trample underfoot the maned lion and the big snake.+ 
14  God said: “Because he has affection for me,* I will rescue him.+ I will protect him because he knows* my name.+ 
15  He will call on me, and I will answer him.+ I will be with him in distress.+ I will rescue him and glorify him. 
16  I will satisfy him with long life,+And I will cause him to see my acts of salvation.”*+
