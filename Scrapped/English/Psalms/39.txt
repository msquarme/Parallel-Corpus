39  I said: “I will guard my stepTo avoid sinning with my tongue.+ I will guard my mouth with a muzzle+As long as anyone wicked is in my presence.” 
 2  I was speechless and silent;+I kept quiet even about what is good,But my pain was intense.* 
 3  My heart smoldered* inside me. As I pondered,* the fire kept burning. Then my tongue spoke: 
 4  “O Jehovah, help me to know what my end will be,And the measure of my days,+So that I may know how short my life is.* 
 5  Indeed, you have made my days just a few;*+And my life span is as nothing before you.+ Surely every man, though he seems secure, is nothing but a mere breath.+ (Selah) 
 6  Surely every man walks about like a shadow. He rushes around* for nothing. He piles up wealth, not knowing who will enjoy it.+ 
 7  What, then, can I hope for, O Jehovah? You are my only hope. 
 8  Save me from all my transgressions.+ Do not let the foolish one make me an object of contempt. 
 9  I remained speechless;I could not open my mouth,+Because this was your doing.+ 
10  Remove your plague from me. I am worn down because your hand strikes me. 
11  You correct man with punishment for his error;+You consume the things he treasures just as a moth does. Surely every man is but a mere breath.+ (Selah) 
12  Hear my prayer, O Jehovah,Listen to my cry for help.+ Do not ignore my tears. For I am but a foreign resident to you,+A traveler passing through,* just like all my forefathers.+ 
13  Turn your harsh gaze away from me so that I may cheer upBefore I pass away and I am gone.”
