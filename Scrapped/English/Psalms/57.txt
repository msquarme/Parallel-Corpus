57  Show me favor, O God, show me favor,For I take* refuge in you,+And in the shadow of your wings I take refuge until the troubles pass.+ 
 2  I call to God the Most High,To the true God, who brings them to an end for me. 
 3  He will send help from heaven and save me.+ He will frustrate the one snapping at me. (Selah) God will send his loyal love and his faithfulness.+ 
 4  I am* surrounded by lions;+I must lie among men who want to devour me,Whose teeth are spears and arrowsAnd whose tongue is a sharp sword.+ 
 5  Be exalted above the heavens, O God;May your glory be over all the earth.+ 
 6  They have prepared a net to ensnare my feet;+I am* bowed down with distress.+ They have dug a pit ahead of me,But they fell into it themselves.+ (Selah) 
 7  My heart is steadfast, O God,+My heart is steadfast. I will sing and make music. 
 8  Do awake, my glory. Do awake, O stringed instrument; you too, O harp. I will awaken the dawn.+ 
 9  I will praise you among the peoples, O Jehovah;+I will sing praises* to you among the nations.+ 
10  For your loyal love is great, as high as the heavens,+And your faithfulness, up to the skies. 
11  Be exalted above the heavens, O God;May your glory be over all the earth.+
