32  Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered.*+ 
 2  Happy is the man whom Jehovah does not charge with guilt,+In whose spirit there is no deceit. 
 3  When I kept silent, my bones wasted away because of my groaning all day long.+ 
 4  For day and night your hand* was heavy upon me.+ My strength evaporated* like water in the dry summer heat. (Selah) 
 5  Finally I confessed my sin to you;I did not cover my error.+ I said: “I will confess my transgressions to Jehovah.”+ And you pardoned the error of my sins.+ (Selah) 
 6  This is why every loyal one will pray to you+While you may yet be found.+ Then even the floodwaters will not reach him. 
 7  You are a hiding place for me;You will safeguard me from distress.+ You will surround me with joyful shouts of deliverance.+ (Selah) 
 8  “I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.+ I will give you advice with my eye upon you.+ 
 9  Do not become like a horse or a mule, without understanding,+Whose spiritedness must be controlled with a bridle or a halterBefore it will come near to you.” 
10  Many are the pains of the wicked;But the one trusting in Jehovah is surrounded by His loyal love.+ 
11  Rejoice in Jehovah and be joyful, you righteous ones;Shout joyfully, all you who are upright in heart.
