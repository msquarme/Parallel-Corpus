148  Praise Jah!* Praise Jehovah from the heavens;+Praise him in the heights. 
 2  Praise him, all his angels.+ Praise him, all his army.+ 
 3  Praise him, sun and moon. Praise him, all shining stars.+ 
 4  Praise him, O highest heavens*And waters above the heavens. 
 5  Let them praise the name of Jehovah,For he commanded, and they were created.+ 
 6  He keeps them established forever and ever;+He has issued a decree that will not pass away.+ 
 7  Praise Jehovah from the earth,You great sea creatures and all deep waters,
 8  You lightning and hail, snow and thick clouds,You storm wind, carrying out his word,+
 9  You mountains and all you hills,+You fruit trees and all you cedars,+
10  You wild animals+ and all you domestic animals,You creeping things and winged birds,
11  You kings of the earth and all you nations,You princes and all you judges of the earth,+
12  You young men and young women,*Old men and young together.* 
13  Let them praise the name of Jehovah,For his name alone is unreachably high.+ His majesty is above earth and heaven.+ 
14  He will exalt the strength* of his people,For the praise of all his loyal ones,Of the sons of Israel, the people close to him. Praise Jah!*
