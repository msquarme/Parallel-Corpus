104  Let me* praise Jehovah.+ O Jehovah my God, you are very great.+ With majesty* and splendor you are clothed.+ 
 2  You are wrapped in light+ as with a garment;You stretch out the heavens like a tent cloth.+ 
 3  He lays beams of his upper rooms in the waters above,*+Making the clouds his chariot,+Moving on the wings of the wind.+ 
 4  He makes his angels spirits,His ministers a consuming fire.+ 
 5  He has established the earth on its foundations;+It will not be moved from its place* forever and ever.+ 
 6  You covered it with deep waters as with a garment.+ The waters stood above the mountains. 
 7  At your rebuke they fled;+At the sound of your thunder they ran away in panic
 8  —Mountains ascended+ and valleys descended—To the place you established for them. 
 9  You set a boundary that they should not pass,+That they should never again cover the earth. 
10  He sends springs into the valleys;*Between the mountains they flow. 
11  They provide water for all the wild beasts of the field;The wild donkeys quench their thirst. 
12  Above them roost the birds of the sky;They sing among the thick foliage. 
13  He is watering the mountains from his upper rooms.+ With the fruitage of your works the earth is satisfied.+ 
14  He is making grass grow for the cattleAnd vegetation for mankind’s use,+To grow food from the land
15  And wine that makes man’s heart rejoice,+Oil that makes the face shine,And bread that sustains the heart of mortal man.+ 
16  The trees of Jehovah are satisfied,The cedars of Lebʹa·non that he planted,
17  Where the birds make nests. The home of the stork+ is in the juniper trees. 
18  The high mountains are for the mountain goats;+The crags are a refuge for the rock badgers.+ 
19  He has made the moon to mark the appointed times;The sun well knows when to set.+ 
20  You bring darkness, and night falls,+When all the wild animals of the forest roam about. 
21  The young lions* roar for their prey+And seek their food from God.+ 
22  When the sun rises,They withdraw and lie down in their dens. 
23  Man goes to his work,And he labors until evening. 
24  How many your works are, O Jehovah!+ You have made all of them in wisdom.+ The earth is full of what you have made. 
25  There is the sea, so great and wide,Teeming with countless living things, both small and great.+ 
26  There the ships travel,And Le·viʹa·than,*+ which you formed to play in it. 
27  All of them wait for youTo give them their food in its season.+ 
28  What you give them, they gather.+ When you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.+ 
29  When you hide your face, they are disturbed. If you take away their spirit, they die and return to the dust.+ 
30  If you send out your spirit, they are created,+And you renew the surface of the ground. 
31  The glory of Jehovah will last forever. Jehovah will rejoice in his works.+ 
32  He looks at the earth, and it trembles;He touches the mountains, and they smoke.+ 
33  I will sing to Jehovah+ throughout my life;I will sing praises* to my God as long as I live.+ 
34  Let my thoughts be pleasing to him.* I will rejoice in Jehovah. 
35  The sinners will vanish from the earth,And the wicked will no longer exist.+ Let me* praise Jehovah. Praise Jah!*
