63  O God, you are my God, I keep looking for you.+ I do thirst* for you.+ I am* faint with longing for youIn a dry and parched land, where there is no water.+ 
 2  So I have looked upon you in the holy place;I have seen your strength and your glory.+ 
 3  Because your loyal love is better than life,+My own lips will glorify you.+ 
 4  Thus I will praise you all my life;In your name I will lift up my hands. 
 5  I am* satisfied with the best and choicest portion,*So my mouth will praise you with joy on my lips.+ 
 6  I remember you while upon my bed;I meditate on you during the watches of the night.+ 
 7  For you are my helper,+And I shout joyfully in the shadow of your wings.+ 
 8  I cling* to you;Your right hand keeps fast hold on me.+ 
 9  But those who seek to destroy my life*Will descend into the depths of the earth. 
10  They will be handed over to the power of the sword;They will become food for jackals.* 
11  But the king will rejoice in God. Every person swearing by Him will exult,*For the mouth of those speaking lies will be silenced.
