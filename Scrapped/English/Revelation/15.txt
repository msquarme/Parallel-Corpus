15  And I saw in heaven another sign, great and wonderful, seven angels+ with seven plagues. These are the last ones, because by means of them the anger of God is brought to a finish.+ 
2  And I saw something like a sea of glass+ mingled with fire, and those who are victorious+ over the wild beast and its image+ and the number of its name+ were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps of God.
3  They were singing the song of Moses+ the slave of God and the song of the Lamb,+ saying: “Great and wonderful are your works,+ Jehovah* God, the Almighty.+ Righteous and true are your ways,+ King of eternity.+
4  Who will not really fear you, Jehovah,* and glorify your name, for you alone are loyal?+ For all the nations will come and worship before you,+ because your righteous decrees have been revealed.” 
5  After this I saw, and the sanctuary of the tent of the witness+ was opened in heaven,+
6  and the seven angels with the seven plagues+ emerged from the sanctuary, clothed with clean, bright linen and with golden sashes wrapped around their chests.
7  One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls that were full of the anger of God,+ who lives forever and ever.
8  And the sanctuary became filled with smoke because of the glory of God+ and because of his power, and no one was able to enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues+ of the seven angels were finished.
