19  After this I heard what seemed to be a loud voice of a great crowd in heaven. They said: “Praise Jah!*+ The salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God,
2  because his judgments are true and righteous.+ For he has executed judgment on the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality,* and he has avenged the blood of his slaves that is on her hands.”*+
3  And right away for the second time they said: “Praise Jah!*+ And the smoke from her goes on ascending forever and ever.”+ 
4  And the 24 elders+ and the four living creatures+ fell down and worshipped God who sits on the throne and said: “Amen! Praise Jah!”*+ 
5  Also, a voice came from the throne and said: “Be praising our God, all you his slaves,+ who fear him, the small ones and the great.”+ 
6  And I heard what sounded like a voice of a great crowd and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of heavy thunders. They said: “Praise Jah,*+ because Jehovah* our God, the Almighty,+ has begun to rule as king!+
7  Let us rejoice and be overjoyed and give him glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself.
8  Yes, it has been granted to her to be clothed with bright, clean, fine linen—for the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones.”+ 
9  And he tells me, “Write: Happy are those invited to the evening meal of the Lamb’s marriage.”+ Also, he tells me: “These are the true sayings of God.”
10  At that I fell down before his feet to worship him. But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that!+ I am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing concerning Jesus.+ Worship God!+ For the witness concerning Jesus is what inspires prophecy.”+ 
11  I saw heaven opened, and look! a white horse.+ And the one seated on it is called Faithful+ and True,+ and he judges and carries on war in righteousness.+
12  His eyes are a fiery flame,+ and on his head are many diadems.* He has a name written that no one knows but he himself,
13  and he is clothed with an outer garment stained* with blood, and he is called by the name The Word+ of God.
14  Also, the armies in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen.
15  And out of his mouth protrudes a sharp, long sword+ with which to strike the nations, and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron.+ Moreover, he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.+
16  On his outer garment, yes, on his thigh, he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.+ 
17  I saw also an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice and said to all the birds that fly in midheaven:* “Come here, be gathered together to the great evening meal of God,+
18  so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of military commanders and the flesh of strong men+ and the flesh of horses and of those seated on them,+ and the flesh of all, of freemen as well as of slaves and of small ones and great.” 
19  And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the one seated on the horse and against his army.+
20  And the wild beast was caught, and along with it the false prophet+ that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast+ and those who worship its image.+ While still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur.+
21  But the rest were killed off with the long sword that proceeded out of the mouth of the one seated on the horse.+ And all the birds were filled with their flesh.+
