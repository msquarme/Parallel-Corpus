10  And I saw another strong angel descending from heaven, arrayed* with a cloud, and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was like the sun,+ and his legs* were like pillars of fire,
2  and he had in his hand a little scroll that had been unrolled. And he set his right foot on the sea, but his left one on the earth,
3  and he cried out with a loud voice just as when a lion roars.+ And when he cried out, the voices of the seven thunders+ spoke. 
4  Now when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, but I heard a voice out of heaven+ say: “Seal up the things the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them down.”
5  The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the earth raised his right hand to heaven,
6  and he swore by the One who lives forever and ever,+ who created the heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it:+ “There will be no delay any longer.
7  But in the days when the seventh angel+ is about to blow his trumpet,+ the sacred secret+ that God declared as good news to his own slaves the prophets+ is indeed brought to a finish.” 
8  And I heard the voice out of heaven+ speaking again with me and saying: “Go, take the opened scroll that is in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the earth.”+
9  I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. He said to me: “Take it and eat it up,+ and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet like honey.”
10  I took the little scroll out of the hand of the angel and ate it,+ and in my mouth it was sweet like honey,+ but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.
11  And they said to me: “You must prophesy again about peoples and nations and tongues* and many kings.”
