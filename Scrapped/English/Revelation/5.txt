5  And I saw in the right hand of the One seated on the throne+ a scroll written on both sides,* sealed tight with seven seals.
2  And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice: “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”
3  But no one in heaven or on earth or underneath the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.
4  I gave way to a great deal of weeping because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
5  But one of the elders said to me: “Stop weeping. Look! The Lion of the tribe of Judah,+ the root+ of David,+ has conquered+ so as to open the scroll and its seven seals.” 
6  And I saw standing in the midst* of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders+ a lamb+ that seemed to have been slaughtered,+ having seven horns and seven eyes, and the eyes mean the seven spirits of God+ that have been sent out into the whole earth.
7  At once he came forward and took it out of the right hand of the One seated on the throne.+
8  When he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the 24 elders+ fell down before the Lamb, and each one had a harp and golden bowls that were full of incense. (The incense means the prayers of the holy ones.)+
9  And they sing a new song,+ saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, for you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought people for God+ out of every tribe and tongue* and people and nation,+
10  and you made them to be a kingdom+ and priests to our God,+ and they are to rule as kings+ over the earth.” 
11  And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads* and thousands of thousands,+
12  and they were saying with a loud voice: “The Lamb who was slaughtered+ is worthy to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.”+ 
13  And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and underneath the earth+ and on the sea, and all the things in them, saying: “To the One sitting on the throne+ and to the Lamb+ be the blessing and the honor+ and the glory and the might forever and ever.”+
14  The four living creatures were saying: “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshipped.
