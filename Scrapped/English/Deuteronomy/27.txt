27  Then Moses together with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying: “Observe every commandment that I am giving you today.
2  And in the day when you will cross the Jordan into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, set up large stones and cover them with plaster.*+
3  Then write on them all the words of this Law when you have crossed over, so that you may enter into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as Jehovah, the God of your forefathers, has promised you.+
4  When you have crossed the Jordan, you should set up these stones on Mount Eʹbal+ and cover them with plaster,* just as I am commanding you today.
5  You are also to build an altar there to Jehovah your God, an altar of stones. You should not use iron tools on them.+
6  You should build the altar of Jehovah your God with whole stones and offer burnt offerings to Jehovah your God on it.
7  You are to offer communion sacrifices+ and eat them there,+ and you will rejoice before Jehovah your God.+
8  And clearly write on the stones all the words of this Law.”+ 
9  Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying: “Keep silent and listen, O Israel. This day you have become the people of Jehovah your God.+
10  You must listen to the voice of Jehovah your God and carry out his commandments+ and his regulations, which I am commanding you today.” 
11  On that day Moses commanded the people, saying:
12  “The following tribes will stand on Mount Gerʹi·zim+ to bless the people when you have crossed the Jordan: Simʹe·on, Leʹvi, Judah, Isʹsa·char, Joseph, and Benjamin.
13  And the following will stand on Mount Eʹbal+ to pronounce the curse: Reuʹben, Gad, Ashʹer, Zebʹu·lun, Dan, and Naphʹta·li.
14  And the Levites will answer every man of Israel with a loud voice:+ 
15  “‘Cursed is the man who makes a carved image+ or a metal statue,*+ a thing detestable to Jehovah,+ the workmanship of the hands of a craftsman,* and who has hidden it.’ (And all the people will respond, saying, ‘Amen!’*) 
16  “‘Cursed is the one who treats his father or his mother with contempt.’+ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 
17  “‘Cursed is the one who moves his neighbor’s boundary marker.’+ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 
18  “‘Cursed is the one who causes a blind person to lose his way on the road.’+ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 
19  “‘Cursed is the one who perverts the judgment+ of a foreign resident, a fatherless child,* or a widow.’+ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 
20  “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with his father’s wife, for he has dishonored his father.’*+ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 
21  “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with any animal.’+ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 
22  “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’+ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 
23  “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with his mother-in-law.’+ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 
24  “‘Cursed is the one who ambushes and kills his neighbor.’+ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 
25  “‘Cursed is the one who accepts a bribe to kill* an innocent person.’*+ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 
26  “‘Cursed is the one who will not uphold the words of this Law by carrying them out.’+ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’)
