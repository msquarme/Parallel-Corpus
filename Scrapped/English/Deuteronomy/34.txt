34  Then Moses went up from the desert plains of Moʹab to Mount Neʹbo,+ to the top of Pisʹgah,+ which faces Jerʹi·cho.+ And Jehovah showed him all the land, from Gilʹe·ad to Dan,+
2  and all Naphʹta·li and the land of Eʹphra·im and Ma·nasʹseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea,*+
3  and the Negʹeb+ and the District,+ the valley plain of Jerʹi·cho, the city of the palm trees, as far as Zoʹar.+ 
4  Jehovah then said to him: “This is the land about which I have sworn to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘To your offspring* I will give it.’+ I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross over there.”+ 
5  After that Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moʹab just as Jehovah had said.+
6  He buried him in the valley in the land of Moʹab, opposite Beth-peʹor, and nobody knows where his grave is down to this day.+
7  Moses was 120 years old at his death.+ His eyes had not grown dim, and his strength had not departed.
8  The people of Israel wept for Moses on the desert plains of Moʹab for 30 days.+ Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were completed. 
9  Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hand on him;+ and the Israelites began to listen to him, and they did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.+
10  But there has never again arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses,+ whom Jehovah knew face-to-face.+
11  He performed all the signs and the miracles that Jehovah had sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharʹaoh and all his servants and all his land,+
12  along with the mighty hand and the awesome power that Moses displayed before the eyes of all Israel.+
