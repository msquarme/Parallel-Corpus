3  Woe to the rebellious, the polluted, the oppressive city!+ 
 2  She has obeyed no voice;+ she has accepted no discipline.+ In Jehovah she has not trusted;+ she has not drawn near to her God.+ 
 3  Her princes within her are roaring lions.+ Her judges are wolves in the night;They do not leave even a bone to gnaw until morning. 
 4  Her prophets are insolent, treacherous men.+ Her priests defile what is holy;+They do violence to the law.+ 
 5  Jehovah is righteous in her midst;+ he does no wrong. Morning by morning he makes known his judgments,+As unfailing as the daylight. But the unrighteous one knows no shame.+ 
 6  “I destroyed nations; their corner towers were left desolate. I devastated their streets, so that no one was passing through. Their cities were left in ruins, without a man, without an inhabitant.+ 
 7  I said, ‘Surely you will fear me and accept discipline,’*+ So that her dwelling place might not be destroyed+—I must call her to account for* all these things. But they were all the more eager to act corruptly.+ 
 8  ‘So keep yourselves in expectation of* me,’+ declares Jehovah,‘Until the day when I rise up to take plunder,*For my judicial decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms,To pour out on them my indignation, all my burning anger;+For by the fire of my zeal the whole earth will be consumed.+ 
 9  For then I will change the language of the peoples to a pure language,So that all of them may call on the name of Jehovah,To serve him shoulder to shoulder.’*+ 
10  From the region of the rivers of E·thi·oʹpi·a,Those entreating me, the daughter of my scattered ones, will bring a gift to me.+ 
11  On that day you will not be put to shameBecause of all your deeds with which you rebelled against me,+For then I will remove the haughty boasters from among you;And you will never again be haughty in my holy mountain.+ 
12  I will allow a humble and lowly people to remain in your midst,+And they will take refuge in the name of Jehovah. 
13  Those remaining of Israel+ will practice no unrighteousness;+They will not speak a lie, nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths;They will feed* and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.”+ 
14  Shout joyfully, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O Israel!+ Be joyful and rejoice with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!+ 
15  Jehovah has removed the judgments against you.+ He has turned away your enemy.+ The King of Israel, Jehovah, is in your midst.+ You will fear calamity no more.+ 
16  On that day it will be said to Jerusalem: “Do not be afraid, O Zion.+ Do not let your hands drop down. 
17  Jehovah your God is in your midst.+ As a mighty One, he will save. He will exult over you with great joy.+ He will become silent* in his love. He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy. 
18  I will gather together those grieving over their absence from your festivals;+They were absent from you because of bearing reproach for her.+ 
19  Look! At that time I will act against all those oppressing you;+And I will save the one limping,+And I will gather together the dispersed.+ I will make them an object of praise and fame*In all the land of their shame. 
20  At that time I will bring you in,At the time I gather you together. For I will make you an object of fame* and praise+ among all the peoples of the earth,When I gather back your captives before your eyes,” says Jehovah.+
