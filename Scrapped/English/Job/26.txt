26  Job said in reply: 
 2  “How you have helped the one with no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength!+ 
 3  What great advice you have given to the one lacking wisdom!+ How freely* you have revealed your practical wisdom!* 
 4  To whom are you trying to speak,And who inspired you to say such things?* 
 5  Those who are powerless in death tremble;They are even lower than the waters and their inhabitants. 
 6  The Grave* is naked in front of God,*+And the place of destruction* lies uncovered. 
 7  He stretches out the northern sky* over empty space,*+Suspending the earth upon nothing;
 8  He wraps up the waters in his clouds,+So that the clouds do not burst under their weight;
 9  He shuts off the view of his throne,Spreading out his cloud over it.+ 
10  He marks out the horizon* on the surface of the waters;+He makes a boundary between light and darkness. 
11  The very pillars of heaven shake;They are stunned by his rebuke. 
12  He stirs up the sea with his power,+And by his understanding he breaks the sea monster* to pieces.+ 
13  With his breath* he makes the skies clear;His hand pierces the elusive* serpent. 
14  Look! These are just the fringes of his ways;+Only a faint whisper has been heard of him! So who can understand his mighty thunder?”+
