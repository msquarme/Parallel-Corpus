4  Elʹi·phaz+ the Teʹman·ite then said in reply: 
 2  “If someone tries to speak to you, will you become impatient? For who can hold back from speaking? 
 3  True, you have corrected many,And you used to strengthen the weak hands. 
 4  Your words would raise up anyone stumbling,And you would strengthen those whose knees were buckling. 
 5  But now it has happened to you, and you are overwhelmed;*It touches you, and you are dismayed. 
 6  Does your reverence for God not give you confidence? Does your way of integrity+ not give you hope? 
 7  Remember, please: What innocent person has ever perished? When have the upright ever been destroyed? 
 8  What I have seen is that those who plow* what is harmfulAnd those who sow trouble will reap the same. 
 9  By the breath of God they perish,And through a blast of his anger they come to an end. 
10  The lion roars, and a young lion growls,But even the teeth of strong lions* are broken. 
11  A lion perishes for lack of prey,And the cubs of a lion are scattered. 
12  Now a word was brought to me in secret,And a whisper of it reached my ear. 
13  In troubling thoughts during visions of the night,When deep sleep falls upon men,
14  A terrible trembling came upon me,Filling all my bones with dread. 
15  A spirit passed over my face;The hair of my flesh bristled. 
16  It then stood still,But I did not recognize its appearance. A form was in front of my eyes;There was a calm, and then I heard a voice: 
17  ‘Can a mortal man be more righteous than God? Can a man be cleaner than his own Maker?’ 
18  Look! He has no faith in his servants,And he finds fault with his angels.* 
19  How much more so with those dwelling in houses of clay,Whose foundation is in the dust,+Who are crushed as easily as a moth! 
20  They are completely crushed from morning to evening;They perish forever, and no one takes notice. 
21  Are they not like a tent whose cord is pulled out? They die without wisdom.
