31  “I have made a covenant with my eyes.+ So how could I show improper attention to a virgin?+ 
 2  What, then, would be my share from God above,What inheritance from the Almighty on high? 
 3  Does not disaster await the wrongdoerAnd calamity those doing what is harmful?+ 
 4  Does he not see my ways+And count all my steps? 
 5  Have I ever walked in untruth?* Has my foot hurried to deceive?+ 
 6  Let God weigh me with accurate scales;+Then he will recognize my integrity.+ 
 7  If my footsteps deviate from the way+Or my heart has followed after my eyes+Or my hands have been defiled,
 8  Then let me sow seed and someone else eat,+And let what I plant be uprooted.* 
 9  If my heart has been enticed by a woman+And I have lain in wait+ at my neighbor’s door,
10  Then let my wife grind grain for another man,And let other men have sexual relations with her.*+ 
11  For that would be shameful conduct,An error deserving punishment by the judges.+ 
12  It would be a fire that would devour and destroy,*+Consuming even the roots of* all my produce. 
13  If I denied justice to my male or female servantsWhen they had a complaint* against me,
14  What can I do when God confronts me?* What can I answer him when he calls for an accounting?+ 
15  Did not the One who made me in the womb also make them?+ Was it not the same One who formed us before our birth?*+ 
16  If I refused to give the poor what they desired+Or saddened the eyes of the widow;*+
17  If I ate my portion of food aloneWithout sharing it with the orphans;+
18  (For from my youth the orphan* grew up with me as though I were his father,And I have been a guide for the widow* from childhood.*) 
19  If I saw anyone perishing for lack of clothingOr a poor man with nothing to cover himself;+
20  If he* did not bless me+As he warmed himself with the wool of my sheep;
21  If I shook my fist against the orphan+When he needed my assistance in the city gate;*+
22  Then let my arm* fall from my shoulder,And let my arm be broken at the elbow.* 
23  For I dreaded disaster from God,And I could not stand before his dignity. 
24  If I put my confidence in goldOr said to fine gold, ‘You are my security!’+ 
25  If I found my joy in my great wealth+Because of the many possessions I acquired;+
26  If I saw the sun* shiningOr the moon moving in its splendor;+
27  And my heart was secretly enticed,And my mouth kissed my hand in worship of them;+
28  Then that would be an error deserving punishment by the judges,For I would have denied the true God above. 
29  Have I ever rejoiced over the destruction of my enemy+Or gloated because evil befell him? 
30  I never allowed my mouth to sinBy asking for his life* in an oath.+ 
31  Have the men of my tent not said,‘Who can find anyone who has not been satisfied with his food?’*+ 
32  No stranger* had to spend the night outside;+I opened my doors to the traveler. 
33  Have I ever tried to cover over my transgressions, like other men,+By hiding my error in the pocket of my garment? 
34  Have I been in fear of the reaction of the multitude,Or have I been terrified by the contempt of other families,Making me silent and afraid to go outside? 
35  If only someone would listen to me!+ I would sign my name to what I have said.* Let the Almighty answer me!+ If only my accuser had written out the charges in a document! 
36  I would carry it on my shoulder,And I would bind it around my head like a crown. 
37  I would give him an accounting for every step I took;I would approach him confidently, like a prince. 
38  If my own ground would cry out against meAnd its furrows would weep together;
39  If I have eaten its fruitage without payment,+Or if I have caused its owners* to despair;+
40  Then let thorns sprout for me instead of wheatAnd foul-smelling weeds instead of barley.” The words of Job end here.
