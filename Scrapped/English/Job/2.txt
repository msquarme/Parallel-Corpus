2  Afterward the day came when the sons of the true God*+ entered to take their station before Jehovah,+ and Satan also entered among them to take his station before Jehovah.+ 
2  Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Jehovah: “From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.”+
3  And Jehovah said to Satan: “Have you taken note of* my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity,*+ fearing God and shunning what is bad. He is still holding firmly to his integrity,+ even though you try to incite me against him+ to destroy* him for no reason.”
4  But Satan answered Jehovah: “Skin for skin. A man will give everything that he has for his life.*
5  But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike his bone and flesh, and he will surely curse you to your very face.”+ 
6  Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! He is in your hand!* Only do not take his life!”*
7  So Satan went out from the presence* of Jehovah and struck Job with painful boils*+ from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
8  And Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself, and he was sitting among the ashes.+ 
9  Finally his wife said to him: “Are you still holding firmly to your integrity? Curse God and die!”
10  But he said to her: “You are talking like one of the senseless women. Should we accept only what is good from the true God and not accept also what is bad?”+ In all of this, Job did not sin with his lips.+ 
11  Three companions* of Job heard about all the calamities that had come upon him, and each came from his own place—Elʹi·phaz+ the Teʹman·ite, Bilʹdad+ the Shuʹhite,+ and Zoʹphar+ the Naʹa·ma·thite. So they agreed to meet together to go and sympathize with Job and comfort him.
12  When they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. They began to weep loudly and to rip their garments apart, and they threw dust into the air and onto their heads.+
13  Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.+
