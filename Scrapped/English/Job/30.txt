30  “Now they laugh at me+—Men younger than I am,Whose fathers I would have refusedTo put with the dogs that guarded my flock. 
 2  Of what use was the power of their hands to me? Their vigor has perished. 
 3  They are worn out from want and hunger;They gnaw at the parched groundThat was already ruined and desolated. 
 4  They gather the salt herb from the bushes;Their food is the root of broom trees. 
 5  They are driven out of the community;+People shout at them as they would at a thief. 
 6  They live on the slopes of ravines,*In holes in the ground and in the rocks. 
 7  From the bushes they cry outAnd huddle together among the nettles. 
 8  As sons of the senseless and the nameless ones,They have been driven* out of the land. 
 9  But now they mock me even in their songs;+I have become an object of scorn* to them.+ 
10  They detest me and keep their distance from me;+They do not hesitate to spit in my face.+ 
11  Because God has disarmed me* and humbled me,They throw off all restraint* in my presence. 
12  On my right they rise up like a mob;They put me to flightAnd put up barriers of destruction in my path. 
13  They tear up my roadwaysAnd make my calamity worse,+Without anyone to stop them.* 
14  They come as if through a wide breach in the wall;They roll in amid the devastation. 
15  Terror overwhelms me;My dignity is driven away like the wind,And my salvation vanishes like a cloud. 
16  Now my life* ebbs from me;+Days of affliction+ take hold of me. 
17  Aching pierces my bones* at night;+The gnawing pain never stops.+ 
18  With great force my garment is disfigured;*Like the collar of my garment, it chokes me. 
19  God has thrown me down into the mud;I am reduced to dust and ashes. 
20  I cry to you for help, but you do not answer me;+I stand up, but you just look at me. 
21  You have cruelly turned against me;+With the full might of your hand, you assault me. 
22  You pick me up and carry me off with the wind;Then you toss me about in the storm.* 
23  For I know that you will bring me down to death,To the house where everyone living will meet. 
24  But no one would strike at a broken man*+As he cries for help during his time of disaster. 
25  Have I not wept for those who have fallen on hard times?* Have I* not grieved for the poor?+ 
26  Although I hoped for good, bad came;I expected the light, but darkness came. 
27  The churning inside me did not stop;Days of affliction confronted me. 
28  I walk about gloomy;+ there is no sunlight. In the assembly, I rise and cry for help. 
29  I have become a brother to jackalsAnd a companion to the daughters of the ostrich.+ 
30  My skin has blackened and fallen off;+My bones burn from the heat.* 
31  My harp is used only for mourning,And my flute* for the sound of weeping.
