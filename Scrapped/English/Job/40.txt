40  Jehovah continued to answer Job: 
 2  “Should a faultfinder contend with the Almighty?+ Let the one who wants to reprove God answer.”+ 
 3  Job said in answer to Jehovah: 
 4  “Look! I am unworthy.+ What can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.+ 
 5  I spoke once, but I will not answer again;Twice, but I will say no more.” 
 6  Then Jehovah answered Job out of the windstorm:+ 
 7  “Brace yourself, please, like a man;I will question you, and you inform me.+ 
 8  Will you call into question* my justice? Will you condemn me so that you may be right?+ 
 9  Do you have an arm as powerful as the true God’s,+Or can your voice thunder like his?+ 
10  Adorn yourself, please, with glory and majesty;Clothe yourself with dignity and splendor. 
11  Release the fury of your anger;Look at everyone who is haughty, and bring him low. 
12  Look at everyone who is haughty, and humble him,And tread down the wicked where they stand. 
13  Hide them all in the dust;Bind them* in the hidden place,
14  Then even I would acknowledge to you*That your right hand can save you. 
15  Here, now, is Be·heʹmoth,* which I made as I made you. It eats grass like a bull. 
16  Look at the strength in its hipsAnd the power in the muscles of its belly! 
17  It stiffens its tail like a cedar;The sinews of its thighs are woven together. 
18  Its bones are tubes of copper;Its limbs are like wrought-iron rods. 
19  It ranks first* among the works of God;Only its Maker can approach it with his sword. 
20  For the mountains produce food for it,Where all the wild animals play. 
21  It lies down under the lotus trees,In the shelter of the reeds of the marsh. 
22  The lotus trees cast their shadow on it,And the poplars of the valley* surround it. 
23  If the river is turbulent, it does not panic. It is confident, although the Jordan+ rushes against its mouth. 
24  Can anyone capture it while it is watching,Or pierce its nose with a hook?*
