24  “Why does the Almighty not set a time?+ Why do those who know him not see his day?* 
 2  People move boundary markers;+They carry off flocks for their own pasture. 
 3  They drive away the donkey of fatherless childrenAnd seize the widow’s bull as security for a loan.*+ 
 4  They force the poor off the road;The helpless of the earth must hide from them.+ 
 5  The poor forage for food like wild donkeys+ in the wilderness;They seek food in the desert for their children. 
 6  They must harvest in another’s field*And glean from the vineyard of the wicked. 
 7  They spend the night naked, without clothing;+They have no covering for the cold. 
 8  They are drenched by the mountain rains;They cling to the rocks for lack of shelter. 
 9  The fatherless child is snatched away from the breast;+And the garments of the poor are taken as security for a loan,+
10  Forcing them to go about naked, without clothing,And hungry, as they carry the sheaves of grain. 
11  They toil among the terrace walls in the heat of the day;*They tread the winepresses, yet they go thirsty.+ 
12  The dying keep groaning in the city;The fatally wounded* cry for help,+But God does not regard this as improper.* 
13  There are those who rebel against light;+They do not recognize its ways,And they do not follow its paths. 
14  The murderer rises at daybreak;He slays the helpless and the poor,+While at night he engages in theft. 
15  The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight,+Saying, ‘No one will see me!’+ And he covers his face. 
16  In the darkness they break into* houses;By day they shut themselves in. They are strangers to the light.+ 
17  For morning is the same as deep darkness for them;They are familiar with the terrors of deep darkness. 
18  But they are swiftly carried away by the waters.* Their portion of the land will be cursed.+ They will not return to their vineyards. 
19  Just as drought and heat take away the melted snow,The Grave* takes away those who have sinned!+ 
20  His mother* will forget him; the maggot will feast on him. He will be remembered no more.+ And unrighteousness will be broken just like a tree. 
21  He preys on the barren woman,And mistreats the widow. 
22  God* will use his strength to do away with the powerful;Though they may rise up, they have no assurance of life. 
23  God* lets them become confident and secure,+But his eyes are on everything they do.*+ 
24  They are exalted for a little while, then they are no more.+ They are brought low+ and gathered like everyone else;They are cut off like heads of grain. 
25  Now who can prove me a liarOr refute my word?”
