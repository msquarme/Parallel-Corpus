10  In the third year of King Cyrus+ of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel, who was called by the name Bel·te·shazʹzar;+ and the message was true, and it was about a great conflict. And he understood the message and was given understanding about what he had seen. 
2  In those days I, Daniel, had been mourning+ for three full weeks.
3  I ate no rich food, and no meat or wine entered my mouth, and I did not put any oil on myself for three full weeks.
4  On the 24th day of the first month, while I was on the bank of the great river, the Tiʹgris,*+
5  I looked up and saw a man clothed in linen,+ and around his waist was a belt of gold from Uʹphaz.
6  His body was like chrysʹo·lite,+ his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like fiery torches, his arms and his feet looked like burnished copper,+ and the sound of his words was like the sound of a multitude.
7  Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men with me did not see the vision.+ However, a great trembling seized them, and they ran away and hid. 
8  Then I was left by myself, and when I saw this great vision, there was no power left in me and my dignified appearance left me and I lost all strength.+
9  Then I heard the sound of him speaking; but when I heard him speaking, I fell fast asleep with my face to the ground.+
10  But then a hand touched me,+ and it stirred me to get up on my hands and knees.
11  Then he said to me: “O Daniel, you very precious* man,+ give attention to the words that I am about to speak to you. Now stand up in your place, for I have been sent to you.” When he said this to me, I stood up, trembling. 
12  He then said to me: “Do not be afraid,+ O Daniel. Your words have been heard from the first day that you gave your heart to understanding and to humbling yourself before your God, and I have come because of your words.+
13  But the prince+ of the royal realm of Persia stood in opposition to me for 21 days. But then Miʹcha·el,*+ one of the foremost princes,* came to help me; and I remained there beside the kings of Persia.
14  I have come to make you understand what will befall your people in the final part of the days,+ because it is a vision yet for the days to come.”+ 
15  Now when he spoke these words to me, I turned my face to the ground and became speechless.
16  Then one who looked like a man touched my lips,+ and I opened my mouth and said to the one who stood in front of me: “My lord, I am shuddering because of the vision, and I have no strength.+
17  So how can my lord’s servant speak with my lord?+ For now I have no strength, and there is no breath left in me.”+ 
18  The one who looked like a man touched me again and strengthened me.+
19  Then he said: “Do not be afraid,+ O very precious* man.+ May you have peace.+ Be strong, yes, be strong.” As he spoke with me I was strengthened and I said: “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.” 
20  Then he said: “Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will go back to fight with the prince of Persia.+ When I leave, the prince of Greece will come.
21  However, I will tell you the things recorded in the writings of truth. There is no one strongly supporting me in these things but Miʹcha·el,+ your prince.+
