22  And David spoke to Jehovah the words of this song+ in the day that Jehovah rescued him out of the hand of all his enemies+ and out of Saul’s hand.+
2  He said: “Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold+ and the One who rescues me.+ 
 3  My God is my rock,+ in whom I take refuge,My shield+ and my horn* of salvation,* my secure refuge*+And my place to flee,+ my savior;+ you who save me from violence. 
 4  I call on Jehovah, who is worthy of praise,And I will be saved from my enemies. 
 5  The waves of death broke all around me;+Flash floods of worthless men terrified me.+ 
 6  The ropes of the Grave* surrounded me;+The snares of death confronted me.+ 
 7  In my distress I called on Jehovah,+To my God I kept calling. Then from his temple he heard my voice,And my cry for help reached his ears.+ 
 8  Back and forth the earth began to shake and rock;+The foundations of the heavens trembled+And shook back and forth because he had been angered.+ 
 9  Smoke ascended from his nostrils,And a consuming fire came from his mouth;+Glowing coals blazed from him. 
10  He made the heavens bend as he descended,+And thick gloom was beneath his feet.+ 
11  He rode on a cherub+ and came flying. He was visible on the wings of a spirit.*+ 
12  Then he put darkness around him as a shelter,+In dark waters and thick clouds. 
13  From the brightness before him fiery coals blazed. 
14  Then Jehovah began to thunder from heaven;+The Most High made his voice heard.+ 
15  He shot his arrows+ and scattered them;Lightning, and he threw them into confusion.+ 
16  The bed of the sea became visible;+The foundations of the land were exposed by the rebuke of Jehovah,By the blast of the breath from his nostrils.+ 
17  He reached down from on high;He took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters.+ 
18  He rescued me from my strong enemy,+From those hating me, who were stronger than I was. 
19  They confronted me on the day of my disaster,+But Jehovah was my support. 
20  He brought me out into a place of safety;*+He rescued me because he was pleased with me.+ 
21  Jehovah rewards me according to my righteousness;+He repays me according to the innocence* of my hands.+ 
22  For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,And I have not wickedly abandoned my God. 
23  All his judgments+ are before me;I will not deviate from his statutes.+ 
24  I will remain blameless+ before him,And I will keep myself from error.+ 
25  May Jehovah repay me according to my righteousness,+According to my innocence before him.+ 
26  With someone loyal you act in loyalty;+With the blameless, mighty man, you deal blamelessly;+
27  With the pure you show yourself pure,+But with the crooked you show yourself shrewd.*+ 
28  For you save those who are humble,+But your eyes are against the haughty, and you abase them.+ 
29  For you are my lamp, O Jehovah;+It is Jehovah who lights up my darkness.+ 
30  With your help I can charge against a marauder band;By God’s power I can scale a wall.+ 
31  The way of the true God is perfect;+The saying of Jehovah is refined.+ He is a shield to all those taking refuge in him.+ 
32  For who is a God besides Jehovah?+ And who is a rock except our God?+ 
33  The true God is my strong fortress,+And he will make my way perfect.+ 
34  He makes my feet like those of a deer;He makes me stand on high places.+ 
35  He trains my hands for warfare;My arms can bend a bow of copper. 
36  You give me your shield of salvation,And your humility makes me great.+ 
37  You widen the path for my footsteps;My feet* will not slip.+ 
38  I will pursue my enemies and annihilate them;I will not return until they are wiped out. 
39  And I will wipe them out and crush them, so that they will not rise up;+They will fall under my feet. 
40  You will equip me with strength for the battle;+You will make my foes collapse under me.+ 
41  You will make my enemies retreat from me;*+I will put an end to* those who hate me.+ 
42  They cry for help, but there is no one to save them;They even cry to Jehovah, but he does not answer them.+ 
43  I will pound them as fine as the dust of the earth;I will pulverize and trample them like mud in the streets. 
44  You will rescue me from the faultfinding of my people.+ You will safeguard me to be the head of nations;+A people whom I have not known will serve me.+ 
45  Foreigners will come cringing before me;+What they hear about me will make them obey me.* 
46  Foreigners will lose courage;*They will come trembling from their strongholds. 
47  Jehovah is alive! Praised be my Rock!+ Let the God of the rock of my salvation be exalted.+ 
48  The true God executes vengeance for me;+He subdues the peoples under me;+
49  He rescues me from my enemies. You lift me high+ above those who attack me;You save me from the man of violence.+ 
50  That is why I will thank you, O Jehovah, among the nations,+And to your name I will sing praises:*+ 
51  He performs great acts of salvation* for his king;+He displays loyal love to his anointed one,To David and his offspring* forever.”+
